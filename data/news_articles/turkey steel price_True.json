    "fullArticle": "Market participants largely expect Turkish deepsea import scrap prices to remain steady in the first quarter of 2024, with seasonally tight supply and elevated freight costs likely to keep offers firm in the near-term despite periods of limited demand.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed Turkish bulk imports of premium heavy melting scrap 1/2 (80:20) at $422/mt CFR Jan. 17. The assessment averaged $395.53/mt CFR in 2023, down from $444.69/mt CFR over 2022, as several macroeconomic and political factors -- including a devastating earthquake, an election period and the outbreak of war in the Middle East -- affected Turkish scrap and finished steel demand at various points of the year.\n\nThe LME scrap forward curve over January-April 2024 is in a soft backwardation, with January contracts assessed by Platts at $415.50/mt Jan. 17, while April contracts were at $398/mt. This suggests futures traders expect a slight correction in physical prices in the near-term, but that prices would remain largely firm in the first quarter of the year.\n\nAfter a round of restocking in early January at elevated levels, recyclers have maintained high offers as scrap availability was heard to have remained seasonally tight, which has kept collection costs in the Benelux and the Baltic regions relatively firm in recent weeks.\n\nHMS collection costs in the Baltic region were recently heard at Eur345/mt delivered to the docks, while prices in the Benelux region were reported at around Eur335-Eur340/mt delivered.\n\nMarket sources anticipated that these collection costs should remain firm for much of Q1, also pointing to recent colder weather in Europe and the US, which has slowed down scrap collection rates in the short-term. This may prevent sharp drops in sellside offers into Turkey.\n\nTurkish mills will likely continue to be heavily reliant on domestic rebar demand amid reduced cost competitiveness in the export market over 2023. Since the devastating earthquake in February 2023 and the expected multi-year reconstruction timeline in southern Turkey, Turkish mills have managed to achieve a premium for domestic sales over export.\n\nPlatts assessed the daily outright spread between Turkish export rebar and import scrap at $187/mt Jan. 12, falling steadily from an assessment of $275/mt Jan. 12, 2023, exactly one year ago.\n\nMarket sources also recently reported fresh rebar sales to different export markets from Turkey, including Jamaica, Yemen, Bulgaria and Romania.\n\n\"Turkey was simply too expensive,\" one European trader said. \"But I believe Turkish mills will now get more traction, not only into the Balkans, but also in Southern Europe.\"\n\nPlatts assessed Turkish export rebar at $610/mt FOB Turkey Jan. 17, recovering from a recent low of $542.50/mt FOB in October 2023.\n\nIn November, Turkish mills exported 301,588 mt of rebar globally, according to the latest Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) data, with Yemen becoming their main export destination. Yemen surpassed Israel, which traditionally had been Turkey's top rebar export market, but volumes have fallen sharply since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\nTurkish market participants have also been closely tracking competing demand for ferrous scrap from India, whose import volumes over the past two years have increased sharply as part of its ambitious target to produce 300 million mt of crude steel by 2030.\n\nIndia imported approximately 30 bulk deepsea ferrous scrap cargoes in 2023, totaling 846,793 mt, according to Global Trade Atlas (GTA), part of S&P Global. India imported 9.25 million mt of ferrous scrap over January-October 2023, according to customs data, which marks a 10.5% increase from 8.37 million mt over the entirety of 2022.\n\nThe Indian market was widely expected to import large volumes of scrap to support the country's prime construction season in Q1 2024, but the anticipated restocking has fallen short so far this year, due to strong availability of scrap domestically and slower-than-expected finished steel sales in the country.\n\nThe containerized shredded scrap market has also been adversely impacted by the ongoing tensions in the Red Sea, which has caused container freight rates for exports from the UK and Europe to India to almost double within a month, making imports of containerized shredded scrap currently unworkable for Indian buyers.\n\nAttacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea by Yemen-based Houthi rebels have led to more ship operators diverting their ships from the Red Sea to around the tip of Africa, adding about two weeks to their voyage time and pushing up freight rates and fuel costs.\n\nPlatts assessed imported containerized shredded scrap at $407.50/mt CFR Nhava Sheva Jan. 12, as Indian buyers have held back from purchasing.\n\nAs a result, the weekly CFR Nhava Sheva containerized shredded scrap prices stood at a rarely seen discount to CFR Turkey import HMS prices in recent weeks, a situation last seen in April 2022.\n\nThe discount stood at $15.50/mt as of Jan. 12. Indian shredded scrap prices have historically averaged a $23.31/mt premium over the weekly average of the Platts CFR Turkey premium HMS 1/2 (80:20) assessment, as of Jan. 12.\n\nLonger-term factors\n\nSome market participants have suggested that a potential end to the war between Israel and Hamas could spur demand for Turkish rebar exports ahead of a potential rebuild in the Gaza strip, which could in turn drive demand and prices for Turkish imports of scrap, although other sources described the idea of a resolution in the near-term as \"wishful thinking.\"\n\nMarket participants will also be closely watching for developments regarding the European Union's proposed legislation on waste shipment exports.\n\nUnder the proposal, EU ferrous scrap exports to non-OECD countries will only be allowed if they can be managed sustainably. The time frame for implementation is unclear, but market sources have previously voiced expectations of 2026-2027.\n\nThe European Parliament's environment committee voted to endorse a provisional agreement on the proposed revision to the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) on Jan. 11. The agreement also requires the endorsement of the member states' representatives within the European Council (Coreper) before it can be formally adopted by both institutions and enter into force.\n\nThe EU is the world's largest exporter of ferrous scrap, exporting 17.59 million mt in 2022, according to the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR).\n\nTurkey, an OECD member, could theoretically benefit in terms of reduced competition for material, should the legislation be approved in its current form. India, a non-OECD member, but now the second-largest seaborne scrap importer, could be affected.\n\nIncreased demand for ferrous scrap globally, and thus greater competition for import-reliant Turkey, is likely to continue in 2024, as steel mills globally look to introduce a greater volume of ferrous scrap into their raw materials mix as a part of a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from production."

    "fullArticle": "Local companies focus on the domestic market and expect to continue exporting to the EU after the introduction of CBAM\n\nTurkiye is the eighth largest steel producer in the world. Over the past two years, its steel production and exports have declined due to global and domestic challenges. However, Turkish companies continue to invest in the expansion of production capacity, counting on the needs of the domestic market.\n\nProduction dynamics\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Turkish steel industry has been on a downward trend, with Turkiye retaining its 8th place in the world ranking of steel producers. According to the Worldsteel Association, Turkish steelmakers will produce 33.7 million tons of steel in 2023 (down 4% y/y) and 35.1 million tons in 2022 (-12.9% y/y).\n\nThe decline in Turkiye\u2019s steel production in 2022-2023 is due to macroeconomic instability, which has led to high uncertainty in the domestic market. As part of the fight against high inflation, which stood at 64.8% annualized in December-2023, the Turkish Central Bank raised the policy rate seven consecutive times during the past year. It rose to 42.5% per annum at the end of the year from 8.5% in June (the rate was raised to 45% per annum in January-2024).\n\nHowever, the tightening of monetary policy did not help prevent the devaluation of the lira, which lost about 60% of its value against the dollar in 2023. On the one hand, the devaluation of the national currency restrains the inflow of imports, which become more expensive. On the other hand, the devaluation of the Turkish lira indicates serious problems in the economy, which also restrains growth of the domestic steel consumption.\n\nTurkish steel industry is based on electric arc furnaces (in 2022, 71.5% of the country\u2019s steel is produced by them), so rising electricity prices remain a major unfavorable factor for the steel industry. According to the Turkish Steel Exporters\u2019 Union (CIB), electricity prices in Turkiye rose sharply in 2022 and accounted for 27% of steel mills\u2019 production costs compared to 8% in 2021. Subsequently, gas and electricity prices for industry were slightly reduced in late 2022 and early 2023, but it was not possible to fully mitigate the impact of this factor on production costs.\n\nOther factors affecting steel production and consumption in Turkiye include the increase in VAT on steel products from 18% to 20%. This decision has a negative impact on the prospects of the domestic market, as it means higher prices for rolled steel products.\n\nThe earthquake that occurred in February 2023 also had a negative impact on the Turkish steel industry, as one third of steel plants were forced to temporarily halt production. Subsequently, it was expected that mills would be able to at least partially recover losses as demand for steel products for construction projects aimed at overcoming the consequences of the earthquake would increase.\n\nConsumption of rolled steel products did rise in 2023 (up 17.1% y/y \u2013 to 38.1 million tons compared to 2022), but this additional demand did not help avoid a 4% y/y drop in steel production. Turkish steelmakers complain that the increase in demand was covered by imported steel products. According to the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD), steel imports to Turkiye increased by 15.5% y/y in 2023.\n\nThe decline in Turkiye\u2019s steel production in 2022-2023 also led to a decrease in ferrous scrap consumption and imports. According to SteelMint, Turkiye\u2019s ferrous scrap consumption in 2023 fell 6% y/y \u2013 to 27 million tons compared to 2022. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), the country reduced its scrap imports by 10% year-on-year \u2013 to 18.83 million tons in 2023. The top five largest suppliers include the US and European countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, Romania).\n\nThe European Steel Association is pushing for stricter controls on scrap exports. The first steps in this direction have already been taken \u2013 from January 2024, a new Waste Shipment Regulation will come into force, which sets technical barriers for scrap exports to countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In case of further tightening of conditions for scrap exports from the EU, Turkiye risks facing a shortage of raw materials for its own steel industry.\n\nExport-import\n\nFor the second year in a row, Turkiye\u2019s steel exports have shown a negative trend. According to the Turkish Steel Association (TCUD), the country\u2019s steel exports fell by 30.6% year-on-year in 2023 \u2013 to 10.5 million tons. Export revenue decreased by 40.7% year-on-year \u2013 to $8.3 billion. In 2022, steel exports from Turkiye decreased by 23.5% year-on-year \u2013 to 15.1 million tons.\n\nIn January-November 2023, imports of steel (including semi-finished products) to the European Union from Turkiye decreased by 51% y/y (average monthly imports for 11 months of 2023 \u2013 199 thousand tons). In 2022 import of Turkish rolled steel products to the European market decreased by 6% \u2013 to 4.33 million tons. Its share in the EU market in 2022 amounted to 15%.\n\nThe reduction in steel exports from Turkiye is due to:\n\nEnergy price differentials around the world. Higher electricity prices in Turkiye have reduced the competitiveness of local producers, while companies from other countries with cheaper energy sources have been able to increase supplies to foreign markets. Active protectionist policies in key export markets. The EU and the US continue to protect local producers from the influx of imports through duties and quotas. In the US, Section 232 (25% duty) applies to Turkish steel products. Export opportunities to the EU are limited by a quota system. In addition, the EU has an anti-dumping duty on Turkish hot-rolled sheets. Increased steel exports from China due to decreased domestic consumption. China is again faced with overproduction of steel, the surplus of which is \u201cpushed\u201d to external markets. This has a negative impact on prices and export opportunities for other countries. Continued supply of steel products from Russia with reputational discounts. Russian suppliers offer lower prices for their steel products to interest consumers in foreign markets. Such supplies, as in the case of increased steel exports from China, also have a negative impact on prices and export prospects of other countries.\n\nTurkiye has not imposed sanctions against Russia, so Turkish companies continue to work with Russian producers, in particular Turkiye imports pig iron and steel semi-finished products from Russia.\n\n\u00abTurkiye has the opportunity to process these raw materials and get higher value-added products that can be exported to the EU and other countries. Of course, the EU sanctions policy includes a ban on imports of steel products made with Russian steel. However, we do not know how the verification mechanism works in practice and how effective it is,\u00bb says GMK Center analyst, Andriy Glushchenko.\n\nIn addition, Turkish producers may use Russian semi-finished products to produce products for the domestic market, while products made of other raw materials may be exported to the EU. Russian raw materials can thus increase export opportunities from Turkiye.\n\nCurrently, this practice has not become widespread. As shown above, steel exports from Turkiye to the EU are falling, Turkish suppliers are losing price competition in the EU market. At the same time, Turkiye is facing an influx of imports. The significant imports has led Turkish industry associations (TCUD, CIB) to demand that the authorities take measures to protect the domestic market.\n\nAs a result, in 2022 Turkiye imposed import duties on hot-rolled steel from the EU. In May 2023, import duties on certain types of flat rolled products were raised by an average of 7%. In particular, for hot-rolled coil \u2013 from 9% to 15%, cold-rolled coil \u2013 from 10% to 17%, alloyed hot-rolled coil \u2013 from 6% to 14%. TCUD positively assessed the impact of this measure on the work of Turkish steelmakers.\n\nIn 2024, the trend to strengthen trade protection continues: in January, duty rates on certain types of flat rolled products were raised, and a temporary duty on imports of wire rod was introduced. In the near term, anti-dumping duties may be introduced on hot-rolled coils from China, Japan, India and the Russian Federation. A review of anti-dumping measures on welded stainless steel pipes from China and Taiwan has also been initiated.\n\nSteel prospects\n\nAnalysts expect the Turkish steel market to improve this year, driven by global growth in steel demand, lower interest rates in the world and others. In its October-2023 report, the Worldsteel Association forecasts steel consumption in Turkiye to grow by 5% \u2013 to 40.6 million tons in 2024.\n\n\u00abTurkish steel demand is expected to grow in 2024. Steel demand will benefit from the earthquake-related construction activities and the abandonment of its unconventional monetary policy that drove foreign investment out of the country.,\u00bb Worldsteel said.\n\nThe TCUD association predicts domestic steel demand will grow in 2024, supporting investment and new capacity coming online in the second half of 2023. In general, Turkish producers Kardemir, Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Colakoglu Metalurji, Has\u00e7elik have planned multi-million dollar investments in new production capacity for 2024 and beyond. Turkish companies want to increase the production of higher value-added products for domestic needs due to difficulties with exports.\n\nTurkiye has a large and growing domestic market, so the future prospects of its steel industry will be based on meeting its needs. Potentially, Turkiye has a chance to continue exporting to the EU, as after the introduction of CBAM scrap-based steel production gives Turkish steelmakers an advantage in the European market compared to other importers."

    "fullArticle": "Let\u2019s start with Turkey. This market peaked out in early February at about $422 per metric ton (mt) CFR, and stubbornly came down to $419/mt for several cargoes of US origin. The cheapest deal in the week ended on Friday, Feb. 16, was from Europe at $412/mt for HMS 80/20, and followed by another at $411/mt. It\u2019s widely reported the Turkish steelmakers need to buy at least 30 cargoes for March shipment. If this happens, they will have to return to the US for a significant number of vessel-loads since there seems to be a seasonal scrap deficit in Europe. With the relative strength in the US market, it may be difficult to bring the delivered price much below $415-420/mt.\n\nThe scrap export market has demonstrated resiliency so far this year from the US East Coast. This strength has mainly come from the Turkish market. Despite weakening orders for rebar in their domestic market, imported scrap prices have held up until the last several days. The US West Coast is not as active, but there are orders in South Asia and in South America that are keeping things afloat.\n\nSMU reached out to a buyer of export-quality HMS for a large exporter. Despite the winter storms \u201cflows have been adequate.\u201d Most terminals have not tried to reduce inbound prices since January. \u201cThis has kept scrap coming in\u201d, he said. Prices reported for remote HMS are in the range of $330-335 per gross ton (gt) delivered to East Coast docks.\n\nOver on the West Coast, there is lack of activity as the Chinese Lunar New Year is in full swing. The bulk export markets are mainly in the South Asian regions of Bangladesh and India. The prices reported in those to areas are in the $410-415/mt range for #1/#2 HMS 80/20 and $10/mt more for shredded.\n\nSMU reached out to Phil Hoffman, chairman of scrap trading company Hoffman Iron and Steel. He said the scrap container markets on the US West Coast are under pressure from other Asian countries, which are exporting to the two major buyers of US-based sellers.\n\nThese buyers are Taiwan and Vietnam. Hoffman estimated the prices to be $370/mt CFR Taiwan and $390 into Vietnam. Most US exporters want $380 to Taiwan. So, if they cannot obtain this price, \u201cthey\u2019ll just sit on it,\u201d Hoffman said. The consensus is the holiday season in Asia will limit activity for a while."

    "fullArticle": "The Turkish market began 2023 with a bullish outlook: Steel production was expected to reach 40 million mt and consumption to exceed 34 million mt. However, the current production dynamics are far from these optimistic numbers and are resulting in lower scrap imports.\n\nCrude steel output in Turkey (Turkiye) fell by 19 percent to 13 million mt between January and May 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The drop is being attributed to the severe earthquake on February 6 of this year that affected a large part of Southern Turkey, especially the Pazarcik district of the southern province Kahramanmaras, the epicentre.\n\nThe natural calamity impacted 11 cities and all steelmaking facilities in Iskenderun, where mills suspended operations due to disruptions of natural gas and electricity supplies, damaged logistics, and damaged infrastructure. In fact, steel production in the region fell by 76 percent in February.\n\nIskenderun is one of the biggest regions for steel trade in Turkey with large mills such as Isdemir, Tosyali Holding, Ekinciler Holding, Yazici Demir Celik, Koc Metalurji, and Bastug Metalurji located here.\n\nAround 105,794 buildings were destroyed or damaged enough to require demolition, according to the Turkish Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change Ministry, which also noted that reconstruction of these earthquake-hit areas would require 4 million mt of rebar.\n\nThe domestic steel sector was expected to fully satisfy this demand as the country was the world's eighth largest steelmaker in 2022 with an annual capacity of around 55 million mt, including around 24 million mt of rebar.\n\nScrap consumption decreases\n\nAll mills in the Iskenderun region resumed operations by April and production was anticipated to recover by May. However, it remains lower than the previous year due to uncertain economic conditions in the country. Thus, crude steel output decreased by 10 percent to 2.9 million mt in May when compared annually.\n\nThis drop in steel production has also affected Turkish ferrous scrap consumption, which fell by 21 percent to 8.58 million mt between January and April from 10.82 million in the first four months of 2022, according to statistical source SteelData. This included 6.66 million mt and 1.92 million mt of imported and domestic material, respectively.\n\nFerrous scrap imports to Turkey dropped by 23 percent to 6.66 million mt in the first four months compared to 8.66 million mt in the same timeframe of 2022. The U.S. - one of Turkey's largest scrap suppliers - reduced shipments of the material by 9 percent to 1.3 million mt, while the Netherlands and Belgium increased them by 5 percent and 3 percent to 859,000 mt and 701,000 mt, respectively, in this timeframe. The U.K. supplied 626,000 mt of scrap to Turkey, Romania exported 366,000 mt, Denmark 362,000 mt, and Lithuania 279,000 mt between January and April.\n\nIn February, ferrous scrap imports by Turkey dropped by 36 percent to 1.2 million mt from 1.9 million mt in the same month of 2022. The key suppliers at that time were the U.S. (280,000 mt), the Netherlands (193,000 mt), and Romania (104,000 mt).\n\nTurkish rebar prices were at $705/mt ex-works, excluding 18 percent VAT, on January 3, according to Davis Index. They jumped to $773/mt ex-works, excluding 18 percent VAT, after the earthquake as the supply from the Iskenderun region was significantly reduced.\n\nThis put pressure on local end users, prompting the Turkish government to ask the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD) to stabilize rebar prices during the next three to four months, considering the increased domestic requirements. It has been almost five months, yet this issue remains unresolved despite several discussions.\n\nNevertheless, rebar prices in Turkey decreased to $636/mt ex-works, excluding 18 percent VAT, by June 20 amid challenging market conditions. Trading has also remained muted following the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. Besides, rebar exports are weak.\n\nThe Davis Index for Turkish export rebar stood at $695/mt fob actual weight on January 5 before rising to $750/mt fob actual weight after the earthquake and subsequently softening to $620/mt fob actual weight on June 20 on limited demand.\n\nTurkey exported 898,000 mt of rebar in the first four months of 2023, down 60 percent compared with 2.23 million mt in the prior-year timeframe, according to SteelData. Long product shipments from Turkey to Israel and Yemen, the country's main outlets for rebar, dropped by 55 percent and 44 percent to 210,000 mt and 183,000 mt, respectively, during this period.\n\nFrom January to April, rebar exports from Turkey to Ethiopia increased by 53 percent to 61,000 mt from 40,000 mt and decreased to the U.S. by 65 percent to 50,000 mt from 143,000 mt. Long product shipment to Panama increased by 70 percent to 48,000 mt from 28,000 mt.\n\nThe Turkish steel industry is expected to recover in the second half of the year and production loss caused by the severe earthquake is anticipated to be fully offset. Reconstruction of earthquake-hit areas is still awaited, which should spur domestic rebar demand.\n\nOlga Yakymchuk is a senior ferrous market analyst at Davis Index and specializes in the Turkish and CIS regions for this segment.

    "fullArticle": "The Turkish lira has lost more than 30% in value since May and because flat steel is traded in US dollars in the country, buyers cannot forecast how much they will pay when they receive the product about two months after placing an order, a steel service center source said.\n\nThe Central Bank of Turkey halted the decline in the Turkish lira by raising the interest rate to 25% from 17.5% from August 24. And on Tuesday, $1 was equivalent to 26.7369 lira, according to Oanda.com, compared with $1 to 19.441 lira on May 1.\n\n\u201c[If] you order about 10,000 tonnes of steel, you need to pay about 200 million lira [and] most companies do not have such [a big] credit limit. In addition, the risk of steel prices decreasing significantly or the Turkish lira losing value [again, are] always there. As a result, we have reduced the tonnages we order to reduce the risk,\u201d the service center source said.\n\nHowever, the main reason for lower-tonnage orders is that demand has been negatively affected, with the current lack of demand worse in the domestic market than for exports.\n\nTurkey is not alone in suffering from a lack of dollars, however, with Egypt also recently suffering from currency issues. The shortage of foreign currency in the country has been inhibiting steelmakers from increasing their exports to have sufficient funds to import raw materials and semi-finished products.\n\n\u201cThe regulations in Egypt require companies to have [sufficient] foreign currency to open letters of credit. Reduced imports and reduced foreign currency collection naturally results in [lower supplies of] raw materials and semi-finished products,\u201d according to Ugur Dalbeler, chief executive of Turkish steelmaker Colakoglu and vice president of the Turkish Steel Exporters Union (\u00c7IB).\n\nThe main problem for Turkey, however, is the negative [impact on] demand because of increased local prices after the loss of value for the Turkish lira, resulting in a big decline in export tonnages\n\n\u201cThe main problem for Turkey, however, is the negative [impact on] demand because of increased local prices after the loss of value for the Turkish lira, resulting in a big decline in export tonnages. [But low-priced] imports from China, Malaysia and South Korea have [recently increased] significantly \u2013 [although] imports from China might fall if the Chinese government decides to reduce steel production,\u201d Dalbeler said early in August.\n\nThe main problem for the flat steel sector in Turkey is the lack of end-user demand caused by economic uncertainty, market participants told Fastmarkets.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish Central Bank\u2019s decision to raise interest rates did not result in [a rebound in the value of the] Turkish lira and, despite the lira being weak, exports are still limited,\u201d a trader told Fastmarkets. \u201cAs a result, steel buyers are waiting for demand in both the local or export markets to improve before placing big orders.\u201d\n\nAnother market participant said: \u201cWe expect September to be stronger in terms of steel market activity, but we still do not expect a very strong market because buyers are hesitant to book big quantities. It is not only about the weak lira; it is about demand from end users.\u201d\n\nTurkey imported 4,762,131 tonnes of flat steel in January-June 2023, 13.60% more than the 4,192,011 tonnes imported in January-June 2022, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK).\n\nThe country exported 1,468,183 tonnes of flat steel in January-June 2023, 40.34% down on the 2,460,802 tonnes exported in the same period of 2022, according to TUIK data.\n\nTurkey produced 15.9 million tonnes of crude steel in January-June 2023, a 16.3% year-on-year decline, according to the Turkish Steel Producers Association (T\u00c7\u00dcD)."

    "fullArticle": "Via Metal Miner\n\nThe fresh conflict between Israel and Hamas in Palestine has started to ring warning bells throughout supply chains for oil, steel, and various metals. Indeed, if prolonged, the conflict could adversely affect steel prices as well as many other commodities.\n\nAlready under strain because of the more than year-old Russian invasion of Ukraine, this new conflict has raised concerns in India as well as among Turkish and Russian steel exporters.\n\nThe President of the trade representative organization PHDCCI, Sanjeev Agarwal, said the conflict could cast a negative light on India\u2019s iron and steel industries, as well as those for other commodities. He added that the countries should reach a resolution quickly for everyone\u2019s benefit.\n\nIn a statement, Agarwal called for a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian conflict in the interest of economic stability. Economist Abhijit Banerjee also referred to the likely impact of the conflict on trade routes and supply chains while highlighting India\u2019s robust relations with Israel on trade.\n\nIndia Turns Net Steel Importer\n\nIncidentally, on the steel manufacturing front, India just turned a net steel importer for the first time in roughly three years. Indeed, about 1.50 million tons (MT) of finished steel offerings were imported during the July-Sept 2023 quarter, up by 8% on a year-on-year basis. When compared to exports, imports were higher by 0.34 MT. Moreover, crude steel production by Indian firms went up 14.7% to 69.65 MT between April-Sept 2023. This is 61.06 MT more than the same period a year ago.\n\nAnd while China continues to be the biggest steel exporter to India, Russia, the UK, and several other nations remain next on the list. Earlier in the year, Russia became the 2nd largest exporter of semi-finished steel to India. Russia also displaced Japan to become the 2nd largest hot rolled coils supplier and strips to the subcontinent. India\u2019s neighbor, China, also relies on steel from Japan and South Korea as well as the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn fact, the new conflict coming on the heels of the Russian invasion has made Turkish and Russian steel exporters quite nervous. According to this report, Turkey is the largest steel supplier to Israel, and has been since 2002. A long-term conflict could have major implications for steel prices on a local, regional, and global basis.\n\nExperts Monitoring Steel Prices and Supply Chains\n\nSteel analysts say it is obvious that if the conflict between Israel and Hamas were to extend beyond a few days, it would further damage an already poor situation vis-\u00e0-vis the supply of steel and oil across the globe. Take, for example, Turkey\u2019s export of steel to Israel. Last year, it touched 1.56 MT. Included in the export list were rebar, wire rod, and hot rolled flat products. And up until August this year, exports from Turkey were down by about 40% due to competition from Russian importers.\n\nOn the flip side, Israel is a large supplier of scrap to Turkey. If the conflict were to escalate, port operations at Haifa may see some impact, leading to delays and disruptions at the very least. Reports indicate that market players continue to closely monitor the situation and its potential fallout on the steel industry in Turkey, Israel, and Russia.\n\nFor India, the steel story went a bit awry this September. Indeed, a Steel Ministry report accessed by The Hindu BusinessLine said exports had dropped by almost 73% year-on-year to just 0.16 MT. Conversely, imports remained at 0.38 MT, turning the country into a net steel importer.\n\nAnalysts attribute this development to many factors. Indeed, the slowdown in demand from Europe due to the recession, price pressure from China, and a lack of clarity on the reporting guidelines of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism continued to impact exports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, analysts feel global steel prices will continue to see pressure because of these latest developments. After all, the market had already suffered stress from oversupply, the European demand slowdown, and the slowdown in construction activity in China.\n\nBy Sohrab Darabshaw\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

    "fullArticle": "The outbreak of war in Israel could have a significant impact on Turkish and Russian long steel exports, market participants tell Kallanish.\n\nSteel is the largest commodity group imported by Israel from Turkey, while Turkey has been Israel\u2019s largest steel supplier since 2002. Turkish steel exports to Israel in 2022 reached 1.56 million tonnes, with rebar, wire rod, welded pipe, hot rolled flat products and construction components having the largest shares in that order.\n\nAlthough Turkish steel exports to Israel declined 40% on-year in January-August to 741,851t, losing market share to Russian suppliers, Israel still accounts for around 10% of Turkey\u2019s total exports of steel products.\n\nOne third of Turkey\u2019s rebar exports in August were bound for Israel, while January-August rebar exports to Israel totalled 480,800t.\n\nIn the import market, Israel is a supplier of scrap to Turkey, with 275,852t shipped in August. Although the war may result in an increase in Israeli scrap supply in the medium term, it also raises the risk of material containing chemical or explosive substances.\n\nA major Turkish mill supplying rebar to Israel says there were no problems or cancellations recorded on the first business day after the start of the war.\n\n\u201cIn the port of Haifa, to which we are shipping, operations are reported to be continuing as usual. Our agent in Israel says there will be no payment problems as banks have no issues. However, the situation may change at anytime,\u201d says a mill source.\n\nAlthough port services are defined as essential and are therefore supposed to operate \"as usual\", work is being carried out according to an emergency plan and guidelines issued by the relevant authorities. Delays and disruptions are expected since some port employees have been called up by the Israeli military.\n\nThe duration of the war will play an important role in determining the actual impact on Turkey\u2019s steel market. Turkish steel producers are concerned about the developments in the country as the possible loss of their largest export market would come at a time when Turkey\u2019s steel industry is already struggling with high production costs and demand contraction.\n\nAlong with Turkey, China and Russia are also substantial trading partners for Israel.\n\nThe war could notably affect Russian exports, especially of longs, some market participants opine. On the other hand, Russia's exports have been steadily diminishing due to sanctions and the added burden of export taxes from October, which have been challenging to transfer to buyers given weak demand.\n\n\u201cRussia shipped 655,000 tonnes of rebar and wire rod for export to Israel from January to July. Also, in August, at least 60,000-65,000t were added, according to preliminary data,\u201d a Russian trader observes.\n\nRussian authorities ceased publishing foreign trade data in 2022.\n\n\u201cBusiness with Israel is on pause for now. Novostal M\u2019s Abinsk and Balakovo mills were number one suppliers of rebar from Russia [to Israel]. NLMK Kaluga [now acquired by associates of Tula Steel] supplied 5,000-10,000t every month last year. The sales are now paused,\u201d a Russian mill representative says.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say now,\u201d another Russian producer representative says of the war impact outlook. Although uncertainty remains, concerns are growing regarding logistical challenges and rising freight rates due to the conflict, he adds."

We have since heard of deals being concluded at slightly higher prices of around $380\u2013385/t CFR for HMS1/2 80:20.\n\nTurkish scrap prices have increased over the past three weeks due to some restocking activity amid limited supply. Supply is low because scrap collection rates have slowed as temperatures cool. Added to this, many scrap dealers are choosing to hold less inventory as year-end approaches and for tax reasons.\n\nIn the finished steel market, Turkish rebar and HR coil prices rebounded by $10/t WoW to $580/t FOB and $600/t FOB, respectively. This is in line with price movements in Europe and Asia. However, underlying real demand remains suppressed.\n\nThis article was first published by CRU.

    "fullArticle": "Via Metal Miner\n\nTurkish longs and flats producer Haba? recently announced plans to build a downstream cold rolling and tinplate mill. The growing Turkish steel industry brand estimates that the plant will have an annual capacity of 900,000 metric tons. Current plans place the new plant on a greenfield site close to Haba?\u2019 main production facilities at Alia?a. This sits roughly 50 kilometers north of the Western Turkish city of Izmir.\n\nIn a December 22 announcement, Italian equipment provider and contractor Danieli stated that commissioning of the site is due to start in late 2024. Meanwhile, Haba? says the new plant will produce about 250,000 metric tons per year of single- and double-reduction tin plate. Danieli also noted that additional capacity will include another 150,000 metric tons of thin, continuous annealed cold-rolled coil with commercial quality, drawing quality, and HSS grades.\n\nCutting-Edge Cold Rolling Technology for Tinplate\n\nSingle-and double-reduction refers to the number of cold rolling steps that feedstock for tinplate undergoes. In single-reduction\u2019s case, cold rolling occurs only once. Therefore, the resulting tinplate has a smoother surface. This makes it idea for applications requiring a high-quality finish. However, it is not as ductile as double-reduction tinplate, which undergoes cold rolling twice. Specifically, the coil undergoes annealing after the first rolling and then undergoes rolling a second time. Danieli noted that the minimum gauge on tinplate and cold rolled coil will be 0.2mm\n\nTinplate\u2019s main application is in the production of packaging for foodstuffs and beverages. This is mainly due to the metal\u2019s anti-corrosive properties. In addition to tinplate, Danieli added that the new site will also produce 500,000 metric tons per year of semi-finished products, such as electrolytically-cleaned, full-hard coils. \u201cThe new complex comprises four process areas: electrolytic cleaning, cold rolling and tempering, electrolytic tinning, and continuous annealing,\u201d the Italian supplier said of the new equipment. \u201cThe cleaning section will ensure a completely enclosed environment, preventing any emission of fumes or liquids.\u201d\n\nHaba? Expects the Factory to Support Wider Turkish Metal Industry\n\nHaba? can produce up to 4.5 million metric tons per year of crude steel via two 90-metric ton electric arc furnaces, from which it originally produced billets in 100x100mm to 160x160mm dimensions via a six-strand casting machine. The plant also rolls 1.9 million metric tons of rebar and 500,000 metric tons of wire rod annually. According to information on Haba?\u2019 website, the rebar and wire rod come in 8-50mm and 5.5-19mm diameters, respectively.\n\nAfter exclusively producing longs products, Haba? began to include flats in its product assortment at the start of the last decade. In 2013, the company commissioned a continuous slab casting machine with a 2.5 million metric ton capacity,to cast the semi-finished product in 200-225mm gauges. It also added a hot strip mill with the same capacity to manufacture flat rolled steel in 1.2-25.4mm gauges. Applications for that product include the shipbuilding sector as well as high-pressure tanks. In addition, Haba? produces spiral-welded pipe with 400-3,048mm exterior diameters and 4-20mm wall thicknesses.\n\nOne source told MetalMiner that the company recently upgraded the hot strip mill, and expects it to achieve its new annual capacity of 4.5 million metric tons in 2024. The source added that any external slabs the company acquires are likely from Russian producer Novolipetsk Steel.\n\nBy Christopher Rivituso\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

    "fullArticle": "The Turkish professional association expects the country's exports to reach $14-45 billion in 2023\n\nThe situation on the global steel market next year will probably not differ from 2023, as current indicators show. This was reported by Bloomberg HT Turkey Ugur Dalbeler, the vice president of the Turkish Steel Exporters Association (CIB), reports Kallanish. At the same time, Turkish steelmakers are positive about the period after 2025.\n\nAccording to Ugur Dalbeler, the volume of Turkish steel exports this year has already fallen by 35% in tonnage and by 40% \u2013 in value. He predicts that in 2023 exports in monetary terms will amount to $14-15 billion, compared to $23 billion in the previous year.\n\nAs the vice-president of CIB noted, the factors of this fall are the impact of inflation and interest rate increases on global demand for steel, protectionist measures, high energy costs of Turkish steelmakers and increased steel exports from China due to a decrease in domestic consumption.\n\nIn particular, the EU and the USA, which are the main export destinations for Turkish steelmakers, are changing the rules of the game.\n\n\u00abWhile the US is announcing new sanctions against the Russian Federation and expecting us to comply with them, they should also grant us the exception that they grant to Brazil, Japan and the EU. On the other hand, the EU provides significant subsidies to the steel industry, contrary to the article of the agreement on the European Coal and Steel Community,\u00bb noted Dalbeler.\n\nAccording to the vice-president of CIB, the strengthening of protectionism will put developing countries, such as Turkiye, in a difficult situation.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, the Turkish Association of Steel Producers (TCUD) urged the government to step in to help the country\u2019s steel industry amid soaring imports. In July 2023, the association noted, steel production in the country increased for the first time in 14 months, but the share of supplies of steel products from abroad also increased significantly. In particular, according to TCUD, steel supplies from China to the country in 7 months of 2023 increased by 85% y/y.\n\nAlso, the central bank of Turkiye unexpectedly at the end of August increased lending rates from 17.5% to 25%. Participants of the Turkish steel market were shocked by such a decision of the Central Bank, as it was previously noted that interest rates will rise at a moderate pace despite high inflation."

    "fullArticle": "The positive trend is maintained due to the growth of demand amid limited supply\n\nSince the beginning of November, scrap prices have been rising in the world\u2019s major markets, including Turkiye, the US and China. The positive trend is supported by limited supply and rising demand ahead of the winter holiday season. As the collection rate is not expected to improve, most market participants expect prices for raw materials to rise further.\n\nPrices for scrap in Turkiye increased by $10/t, or 2.6%, compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $387-390/t CFR for the period November 13-20. Since the beginning of November, scrap quotations on the Turkish market have increased by $24/t, or 6.6% compared to the price as of November 20. In general, a positive price trend has been observed since October 24, as prices had been stagnant since early September.\n\nTurkish scrap prices are supported by demand from local steelmakers. Steel producers are buying raw materials amid an improving steel market and stabilization of other economic factors that have recently hampered trade.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s steelmakers are still facing weak export demand for rebar, as well as problems passing on the rising cost of raw materials to end users. Domestic demand, which is the main driver of the Turkish rebar market, also shows no signs of real recovery.\n\nDespite the negative factors, scrap prices have been kept at high levels \u2013 the highest since early June 2023 \u2013 thanks to a limited supply of raw materials, a stronger euro and rising freight rates. Steel companies are actively replenishing stocks ahead of the winter holiday season, as supply is likely to deteriorate even further.\n\nTurkish steelmakers believe that scrap prices have already reached peak levels and will soon stabilize, as most of the plants are already finalizing cargo bookings, and the sector\u2019s key indicators do not contribute to further growth in raw material prices. At the same time, some of them expect scrap prices to rise to at least $400/t by the end of the year amid low raw material collection rates that will only continue to deteriorate.\n\nThe US market (East Coast) is also growing. As of November 17, prices for raw materials increased by 1.2%, or $4/t, compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $350-351/t FOB. At the same time, the forecast price for November 24 is $356-359/t FOB. In general, since the beginning of November, scrap prices on the East Coast of the United States have increased by $26/t (+8%). Prices have now reached their highest level since early July 2023.\n\nThe upward trend in the US scrap market is supported by rising demand and prices in export markets, particularly in Turkey, as well as rising hot-rolled coil prices in the domestic market. This is expected to support the market in December.\n\nMarket participants believe that prices will rise in the short term, but this growth may be restrained by insufficient demand for raw materials from US steelmakers. On the other hand, trading activity will be supported by limited supply and the desire of steel producers to replenish stocks before the winter holidays.\n\nIn the domestic market of China, the quotations of raw materials also recovered, but the growth rate is much lower than in Turkiye and the United States. For the period of November 13-20, prices increased by 0.8% to $391.31/t. Since the beginning of November, quotes have increased by 2.5%.\n\nLast week, domestic scrap prices were supported by increased demand from steelmakers. The rise in coke prices increased the cost of pig iron, prompting steelmakers to consume more scrap. In addition, the collection of raw materials slowed down while demand started to grow.\n\nCurrently, steelmakers are trying to restrain the rise in scrap prices to avoid rising costs, but market conditions largely depend on the supply of scrap this week. Supply is not expected to recover to demand levels, so prices will continue to rise.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukraine inJanuary-September 2023 increased exports of scrap by 3.7 times per year \u2013 up to 131.1 thousand tons. Imports during this period fell by 50% y/y \u2013 to 0.8 thousand tons."

This is evidenced by data published on the World Steel Association website.\n\nIn June, Turkish steelmakers produced 2.94 million tons of steel, which is 2% more compared to May, but 1.5% less by June 2022.\n\nTurkish oil pipeline corporation BOTA\u015e has left the price of natural gas for industrial enterprises unchanged for the second month in a row, although local steelmakers expected that the cost of energy resources would fall further after falling since the beginning of the year. The reduction in prices somewhat relieves the situation of Turkish steel producers, whose competitiveness is still low in export markets.\n\nFrom April 1, 2023, BOTA\u015e reduced wholesale prices for natural gas for large industrial enterprises by another 20.01% compared to March. This is the third consecutive gas price cut in the country in 2023. In February, gas for industry fell in price by 13-17%, and in March \u2013 by 21-26%.\n\nCompared to October 2022, when gas prices in Turkiye reached peak values, the wholesale price of gas for industry as of April 2023 has decreased by 52.43-63.63%, and for electricity producers \u2013 by 51.52%.\n\nAfter the latest price adjustment, Turkiye has the lowest natural gas price among European countries.\n\nIn addition, according to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, from April 1, 2023, prices for electricity for all consumers decreased by another 15% after 16% decrease at the end of 2022.\n\nAt the same time, after the Turkish elections, the macroeconomic situation in the country is still not stable. In particular, the government recently raised the VAT as well as the excise tax on fuel, which caused a deterioration in the situation on the domestic steel market at a time when export markets are not available at current product prices. Metallurgists expect that an increase in energy prices may be implemented soon.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, T\u00fcrkiye ranks eighth in the world in terms of steel production. In 2022, Turkish steel companies reduced production of steel by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons."

    "fullArticle": "In this way, steel producers plan to prevent the increase in imports of dumped and low-quality products and to resume exports\n\nSteel companies of Turkiye once again called to take protectionist measures to prevent the import of dumped and low-quality products into the country, relying on global practices, in particular the United States and the European Union. Kallanish reports about it with the reference to the Turkish Association of Steel Manufacturers (TCUD).\n\n\u00abThis is vital both for our foreign trade in steel and for the economy of our country. Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea and Indonesia, whose competitiveness has increased due to falling energy prices, have gradually increased their shares in Turkiye\u2019s traditional markets, especially the EU, reducing our steel exports. At the same time, Turkish steel imports from Asia have increased amid dumping prices, which poses a threat to foreign trade in steel,\u00bb said CEO of the association. Veysel Yayan.\n\nIn June, Turkiye reduced steel production by 1.6% y/y \u2013 to 2.9 million tons. In January-June, the indicator fell by 16.3% y/y \u2013 to 15.9 million tons Steel consumption in June amounted to 3.3 million tons, which is 24.7% less y/y, and in 6 months \u2013 19.9 million tons (-15.8% y/y).\n\nExport of steel products fell by 40.8% y/y in June \u2013 to 875.9 thousand tons, and for the first half of the year \u2013 by 46.5%, to 4.5 million tons. At the same time, imports increased by 12.1% in June \u2013 up to 1.5 million tons. For 6 months, imports amounted to 9.5 million tons (+23% y/y). In particular, the increase in the import of wire rod reached 82.5%, which caused a 43.4% year-on-year increase in the supply of rolled products.\n\n\u00abThe extraordinary increase in the import of long rolled products, of which Turkiye is a net exporter, increased the foreign trade deficit of this sector. Despite a drop in the country\u2019s steel output, domestic demand grew by 15.8% thanks to the reconstruction of cities affected by the earthquake. At the same time, this demand was covered by imports,\u00bb commented Veysel Yayan.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Turkish steelmakers have been suffering since March due to the lack of export demand and weak domestic sales. Export markets have been taken over by cheap Asian products, while Turkish-made steel cannot compete on the global stage due to the higher cost, which is justified by the higher cost of production. The domestic market is also inactive due to macroeconomic instability, the devaluation of the lira and uncertainty about the future development of the market. Recently, the Turkish authorities increased VAT on steel products by 20%, as well as an excise tax on fuel, which added even more uncertainty to the steel market in the country."

    "fullArticle": "Russian billet export prices have increased, following the uptrend in scrap values in Turkey. However, a decline has been registered in Turkish demand for Russian-origin billet, weighing on prices, market participants inform Kallanish.\n\nFirstly, Kardemir, a major Turkish billet supplier, is anticipated to increase its prices for domestic buyers to $555-560/tonne ex-works. The Turkish market has been waiting for it to open sales in order to guide on bid levels for Russia-origin billet.\n\nSecondly, EU sanctions are exerting pressure on demand, as opting for Russian-origin billet locks Turkish finished steel sales out of the EU market.\n\nAlso, the generally low export demand for merchant bar, a major segment for imported billet purchasing in Turkey, has contributed to the situation. Merchant bar demand was reported remaining rather weak, keeping Russian-origin billet prices at around $525/t cfr Turkey, whereas Turkish rebar producers were expected to be able to pay approximately $530/t cfr in Turkey\u2019s Black Sea region, according to a supply-side source.\n\nFurthermore, the year-end poses another challenge for Russian billet demand, with Turkish suppliers aiming for increased liquidity on their books and therefore reduced purchasing.\n\nAdverse weather conditions in Russian Black Sea ports have meanwhile hindered prompt-shipment material arrivals before year-end. Decision-making for January-shipment purchases has subsequently been delayed.\n\nPayment terms were also named among the factors. Buyers of Algeria-, Ukraine-, and Malaysia-origin billet opt for letters of credit with 180-day terms, while buyers of Russian-origin have to make cash on discharge payment, a supplier says. However, the non-Russian origins were trading at higher prices, with a recent Algeria-origin deal heard at $555/t cfr Turkey.\n\nA cheap option, Iran, is quoting at $505-507/t dap supplied by truck, also adding pressure on Russian prices in certain areas.\n\nMajor Russian billet producers were offering billet at $500-520/t fob Black Sea, unchanged from a week earlier, and despite falling scrap pricing domestically in Russia.\n\nAt the same time, Russian billet for January shipment was available at $517-519/t cfr Turkish Black Sea, $523/t cfr Izmir and $525-528/t cfr Iskenderun, with cash payment against discharge. This particular supplier maintained prices in order to retain market share.\n\nTwo trading sources, one from Russia, another from Turkey, assessed the market at $525-535/t cfr Turkey.\n\nAs a result, Russian billet is assessed at $495-510/t fob Black Sea compared with $493-500/t fob on 1 December and $495-500/t fob a week ago."

    "fullArticle": "China stands out from the general trend, where a high supply of raw materials hinders price growth\n\nLast week, global scrap prices continued upward trend since the end of October. The Turkish market is supported by a number of factors that force local steelmakers to buy raw materials despite the weak steel market. In the US, prices are supported by demand from Turkish consumers. China, in turn, bucks the trend due to high supply, although the market forecasts growth in the short term.\n\nScrap prices in Turkiye for the period December 1-8, 2023, increased by $13/t or 3.1% compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $428/t CFR. In general, scrap quotations in the Turkish market have been growing since the end of October, and during this period increased by $70/t. In November, the growth amounted to $49/t.\n\nHigh and stable activity in the Turkish scrap market over the past month has contributed to a significant increase in raw material prices. Currently, the supply level has exceeded $400/t, the highest level in the region since early May this year.\n\nThe rise in scrap prices is driven by numerous factors, including higher freight and dockage rates, the strengthening of the euro against the dollar and the projected increase in domestic raw material prices in the US and EU, which are the main suppliers of scrap to Turkey. The scrap market is also supported by the growth in domestic demand for rebar in the country, but this factor is too volatile amid current financial problems.\n\nAt the same time, Turkish plants believe that current price levels are high and unattainable in the current state of the steel market. However, scrap prices are unlikely to decline in the near future due to limited supply, the upcoming winter holidays, rapidly rising freight rates and the needs of steel producers. In such circumstances, we still have to purchase cargoes to avoid facing even higher raw material costs in the future.\n\nIn the short term, scrap prices in Turkiye are likely to stabilize as purchasing intensity slowed slightly in early December. The mills have almost fulfilled their cargo booking requirements for January, and expensive scrap is cutting into their margins.\n\nIn addition, some steelmakers may gradually switch to billets instead of scrap, as this type of raw material is already more competitive. Russian suppliers offer billets for $520-525 per tonne CFR, but despite favorable offers from Russia, Turkish steelmakers are wary of making steel from raw materials from the aggressor country.\n\nIn the US, scrap prices also followed an upward trend. As of December 1-8 this year, scrap prices on the East Coast increased by $16/t (+4.4%) compared to the previous week to $373-377/t FOB. In November, prices increased by $31/t. Thus, prices have now reached their highest level since May 2023.\n\nSentiment in the American scrap market has improved significantly following a sharp rise in prices in Turkiye, the largest export destination. Market participants believe that raw material prices will inevitably rise in December trading amid support for exports and a gradual recovery in US hot rolled coil prices since early November. In addition, the increase in freight due to restrictions on transit through the Panama Canal also supports the market.\n\nIn the Chinese market, scrap prices remained stable at $396.69/t (Heavy Scrap) during the period of December 1-8. At the end of November, raw material quotations increased by $14.6/t (+3.8%) to $396.69/t.\n\nScrap prices in China remained stable last week as supply and demand were balanced. Scrap supply remains high, which does not contribute to positive changes. In addition, imported raw materials have become competitive, which is very rare.\n\nAt the same time, amid a rebound in steel prices and rising profits for steelmakers, some plants have significantly increased their electric arc furnace utilization, which will increase demand for scrap in the short term and is likely to drive up prices.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukraine increased its scrap exports by 3.7 times y/y in January-September 2023 to 131.1 thousand tons. Imports fell by 50% y/y \u2013 to 0.8 kt during this period."

    "fullArticle": "It is difficult for Turkish producers to compete with the region's steelmakers due to higher costs\n\nTurkish steelmakers are increasingly turning their attention to competitors from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, seeing them as a threat to lose their market share. Ahmet Kamil Erchiyas, member of the board of the Association of Steel Exporters of Turkiye, told about it, reports S&P Global.\n\nIn his opinion, it is difficult for Turkish producers to compete with Persian Gulf steelmakers in terms of energy and labor costs.\n\nAccording to Ercias, Turkish mills continue to lose their share in the world market compared to the Persian Gulf countries due to competitive steel offers from the latter.\n\nIn previous years, this region was one of the main export destinations for Turkiye, but thanks to new investments in the steel industry, these countries are becoming competitors of Turkish steelmakers in the world markets.\n\nThe energy consumption of factories in Turkiye has increased even more since October 1, 2023, when it was announced that a further increase in electricity prices by 20% was announced. At the same time, the state-owned Botas said that natural gas prices had risen to the same level.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Turkish Steel Prodcuers Association (TCUD), in the eight months of 2023, the country\u2019s steel mills reduced steel exports by almost 42% year-on-year \u2013 to 6.4 million, while the revenue from these exports decreased by 49% y/y \u2013 to $5.3 billion. The competitiveness of Turkish steel producers amid of weak demand is also affected by high prices for iron ore and scrap.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, according to the Mediterranean Association of Exporters of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals (ADMIB), African markets, especially Algeria and Egypt, are becoming important alternatives export destinations for Turkish steelmakers. This trend is related to the continuation of the global reduction in demand for steel."

Fastmarkets reports about it.\n\nIn July 2023, the association noted, steel production in the country increased for the first time in 14 months, but the share of imports also increased significantly.\n\nAccording to TCUD, steel supplies from China over the first 7 months of 2023 increased by 84% year-on-year. In addition, imports of wire rod to Turkiye in January-July increased by 93.3% year-on-year, hot-rolled steel only under the HS 7208 code tripled compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 to 1.27 million tons.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the Association Veysel Yayan noted that investment in steel in the Gulf countries \u2013 especially Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 will also affect the competitiveness of Turkish producers, as steelmakers in these countries will have an advantage in energy costs. In his view, the Turkish steel sector needs more competitive energy prices along with protective measures to limit the volume of cheap imports.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Turkish steel enterprises in July 2023 increased steel production by 6.4% compared to July 2022 \u2013 up to 2.892 million tons. Compared to June 2023, it decreased by 1.5%. During January-July 2023, the country produced 18.81 million tons of steel, which is 13.5% less than the same period in 2022.\n\nAlso, Chinese steel companies increased export of steel products by 28.4% compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 up to 58.78 million tons. This is evidenced by data from the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA). In August 2023, the country exported 8.28 million tons of steel, which is 13.3% more than in July. Compared to August 2022, the figure fell by 13.9%."

    "fullArticle": "The investigation will refer to the hot-rolled steel by numerical positions\n\nTurkiye has officially launched an anti-dumping investigation into hot-rolled steel from four countries \u2013 China, India, Japan and the Russian Federation. MEsteel informs about it.\n\nThe investigation was initiated based on a complaint filed by the Turkish Steel Producers Association, which represents the interests of local producers, including Colakoglu, Erdemir, Isdemir, Habas and Tosyali. It will cover the period from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2023. It will apply to imports of hot-rolled products under numerical headings containing customs codes 7208, 7211, 7212 and 7225.\n\nIn January-August 2023, China became the leading exporter of hot-rolled coil to Turkiye with a total volume of 1.15 million tons. The Russian Federation is in the second place (531.7 thousand tons), Japan is the third \u2013 393.82 thousand tons. Volume of Indian HRC exports to Turkiye in 2023 was 29,000 tons. However, since 2020, more than 2 million tons of coils have been supplied to Turkish buyers from this country.\n\nAccording to the official notice, during the period covered by the investigation, imports from these four countries increased significantly both in terms of quantity and market share. This surge in imports had a devastating effect on selling prices for domestic products.\n\nThe assessment made on the basis of information, documents and evidence provided by domestic producers shows that there is a deterioration of the main economic indicators of the industry: production and volume of sales in the domestic market, volume and value of stocks, capacity utilization ratio, etc. This led to a negative impact on critical economic indicators and unit profitability.\n\nDuring the investigation, a decision may be made to apply temporary measures, and final measures may be applied retroactively, the message states.\n\n\u00abThe consequence of the previous cycle of increased exports by Asian countries in 2014-2015 was a wave of protectionism around the world. In the near future, we will be able to see the same, particularly in Europe. The fact that preliminary measures can be adopted or tariffs can be introduced retrospectively creates risks for potential buyers, that is, interest in goods from these countries will be less. Import restrictions always have a positive effect on prices. The same can be expected to increase prices for rolls in Turkiye, as well as prices for exports from Turiye,\u00bb noted the chief analyst of GMK Center Andriy Tarasenko.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, in May 2023 it was reported that Turkish producers of hot-rolled coil intend to file a petition in relation to the anti-dumping investigation against the Chinese HRC.\n\nAlso, in September the Turkish Steel Association (TCUD) called on the government to intervene to help the country\u2019s steel industry amid a sharp increase in imports."

Fastmarkets informs about it.\n\nIn May, China exported a total of 1.77 million tons of HRC, which is more than 10% more than in April 2023, but almost 9% less y/y. Exports to Turkiye amounted to 335.8 thousand tons and accounted for almost 19% of the total volume.\n\nDemand from Turkiye was strong a few months ago, especially after the devastating earthquake in February, one trader said. The Turkish government\u2019s increase in import duties, which took effect on May 1 after two delays, had a limited impact on demand for Chinese materials. Buyers from Turkiye could absorb the additional costs, and most of them avoided the duty by re-exporting final products made using imported steel.\n\nAccording to traders, demand from Turkiye for HRC decreased in the run-up to the presidential election in May, but has shown signs of growth in recent weeks due to the emergence of inquiries and small transactions.\n\nThe volume of deliveries to Vietnam, the second largest buyer of Chinese rolled steel in May, in this period amounted to 256.2 thousand tons. The reduction of deliveries to this country was caused by a drop in prices and weak demand in Europe for Vietnamese galvanized coil products In the third place is South Korea, which in May 2023 imported 147.6 thousand tons of HRC from China.\n\nIn May, China imported almost 91.2 thousand tons of hot-rolled coil, which is 65% more m/m and 28% less compared to May 2022.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, world HRC prices fell in June 2023. Such a trend, in particular, is observed on the European market, which was caused by a sharp influx of imports. Steelmakers in China were waiting for the government\u2019s next steps, while Indian companies had to pay attention to global trends and supply timings."

    "fullArticle": "Steel imports to the country for 11 months of the current year amounted to 17.64 million tons, exports \u2013 13.05 million tons\n\nTurkey will become a net importer of steel products this year amid difficult market conditions. This was stated by the Turkish Association of Steel Exporters (CIB), SteelOrbis reports.\n\nIn January-November 2023, steel exports from Turkiye decreased by 28.8% y/y \u2013 to 13.05 million tons, its value fell by 31.2% y/y \u2013 to $13.54 billion. At the same time, steel imports to the country increased by 14.8% y/y \u2013 to 17.64 million tons in the first 11 months of 2023. According to CIB Chairman Adnan Aslan, Turkiye has become a net importer of rolled products, especially wire rod, for the first time since 2015.\n\nAdnan Aslan noted that the decline in exports was due to a number of reasons, including the application of protective measures. In addition, North African countries, such as Egypt and Algeria, to which Turkiye supplies steel, have become net exporters, and the Far East countries have returned to the market with lower freight and container prices,\n\nThe CIB Chairman reminded that other countries are implementing policies to protect their steel industry, while Turkiye is still an open market.\n\nAccording to the industry association, Turkiye\u2019s steel exports will reach 14 million tons in 2023 (previously expected to be 16 million tons). For comparison, in 2022, this figure exceeded 20 million tons. In 2024, Turkish steelmakers are aiming to reach export volumes of 15 million tons.\n\nAccording to Aslan, the country\u2019s steelmaking capacity is currently 50-55% utilized due to lack of demand and rising energy costs. The CIB chairman also said that the industry association has applied for an investigation into the possibility of import subsidies.\n\nUgur Dalbeler, CIB Vice President, noted that monetary policy has led to a contraction in Turkey\u2019s main markets. At the same time, despite the increase in flat-rolled steel production capacity in the country and the corresponding duties, foreign steel suppliers offer low prices, so the Turkish steel industry is forced to cut production. In addition, it is difficult to plan new investments.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, in October 2023, Turkiye increased steel production to its highest level since June 2022, up to 2.965 million tons. In January-October, the country\u2019s steel production amounted to 27.45 million tons, down 8.8% compared to the same period in 2022."

    "fullArticle": "Lower energy prices should help steel producers\n\nTurkish steel products may become more competitive on the world market in the second half of this year. It is said by Fuat Tosiali, President of the Mediterranean Association of exporters of ferrous and non-ferrous metals (ADM\u0130B), reports S&P Global.\n\nAccording to him, this should be facilitated by the recent decrease in energy prices in the country, which will reduce the costs of steel producers.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s steelmakers struggled to compete in export markets last year due to high energy costs. However, in the second half of 2023, Turkiye has a chance to increase the volume of steel exports. However, the second quarter figures may remain weak due to low demand in the global market. According to Fuat Tosyali, Turkish steel producers in the first quarter were not even able to choose EU quotas for some items. Currently, in addition to low demand, the country\u2019s steelmakers are being pressured by lower supply prices from Asian suppliers in export markets.\n\nIn 2022, energy prices in the country rose sharply. According to the Turkish Steel Producers Association, this has caused the share of electricity and gas costs in Turkish steel industry to rise to 28% of total production costs, compared to 8% in 2021.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, from April 1, 2023, the government of the country lowered wholesale prices for natural gas for industrial consumers by 20%. This is the third consecutive decrease in gas prices in the country this year. In February, gas for industry became cheaper by 13-17%, and in March \u2013 by 21-26%. In addition, electricity prices for all consumers have been reduced by 15% since April 1.\n\nIn February 2023, the steelmakers of the country reduced production of steel by 19.2% compared to January 2023 \u2013 to 2.104 million tons. This is evidenced by data from the World Steel Association. Compared to February 2022, Turkish steelmakers reduced steel production by 28.9% in February 2023.\n\nSteel production in Turkiye in 2022 decreased by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons. TCUD expected a fall in production by more than 13%. During the year, steelmakers exported 19.6 million tons of steel, which is 17.7% less year-on-year."

This is evidenced by data, published on the website of the World Steel Association.\n\nCompared to March 2022, Turkish steelmakers reduced steel production by 18.6% in March 2023.\n\nIn January-March 2023, steel companies of Turkiye produced 7.422 million tons of steel, which is 21.5% less than in the same period of 2022.\n\nFrom April 1, 2023, the Turkish Oil Pipeline Corporation BOTA\u015e reduced wholesale prices on natural gas for large industrial enterprises by another 20.01% compared to March.

    "fullArticle": "In most of the world's scrap metal markets, raw material quotations are falling due to reduced demand for steel\n\nGlobal scrap prices continued to decline last week amid weak steel demand and uncertainty over the future economic outlook. As demand for steel stagnates, steel companies see little point in replenishing raw material inventories and continue to put pressure on scrap prices.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap in Turkiye for the week of May 1-8, 2023, fell by 4.5% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $375-385/t.\n\nScrap quotations in Turkiye are under further pressure as buyers show no interest in buying raw materials. Suppliers, meanwhile, have at least one or more cargoes for sale.\n\nAverage offers from sellers from the EU, the Baltics and other regions are $380/t, but some of them are willing to sell at lower prices because they need cash flow and are unable to fight with consumers on price.\n\nThe majority of market participants currently believe that the market price level under such conditions is no higher than $375/t. Some Turkish steelmakers are convinced that prices will drop to $350/ton in the near future. However, even at this level of prices, there is no certainty that steelmakers will return to purchases, because the situation on world markets is quite disappointing \u2013 demand is decreasing, steel prices are falling, and competition is becoming tougher. Uncertainty in sales of finished products restrains the replenishment of raw materials.\n\nSome market participants expect the situation to become more transparent after the presidential election in Turkiye, but most question this possibility and predict the resumption of trade no earlier than September 2023.\n\nThe Chinese market also saw a decline in scrap prices last week \u2013 by 2.1%, to $395.57/t. Chinese scrap prices were steady earlier in the week, but fell sharply as trade resumed after the Labor Day holiday.\n\nDuring the week of May 1-8, 2023, the capacity utilization level of plants operating on electric arc furnaces fell by 10.2 pp \u2013 to 52%. Average daily deliveries of scrap metal to the country\u2019s steel enterprises decreased by 21.6% \u2013 to 207,000 tons, and average daily consumption decreased by 9.4% \u2013 to 261,000 tons.\n\nDeclining scrap prices are significantly reducing the profits of China\u2019s mining industry. Scrap collectors are forced to reduce the supply of raw materials on the market. Such a step can temporarily support prices, but in the case of a steady reduction in steel production, it is not worth counting on a long-term effect.\n\nThe negative state of the Turkish market continues to affect US scrap prices. The price of scrap on the USA market for the week of April 28 \u2013 May 5, 2023, decreased by 3.1% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $374-378/t.\n\nWith no demand from Turkish steelmakers and steel prices continuing to fall, the market does not expect commodity prices to rise in the short term.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in March 2023 decreased by 23.2% compared to the previous month \u2013 to 70.4 thousand tons. The export of scrap metal for March 2023 amounted to 15.5 thousand tons, which is 6.1% less m/m."

    "fullArticle": "The last time gas prices in Turkiye increased in September 2022\n\nThe Turkish Petroleum Pipeline Corporation (BOTA\u015e) has increased wholesale prices for natural gas for large industrial enterprises by 20% from October 2023 compared to August. This is stated in BOTA\u015e press release.\n\nFrom October 1, 2023, the company increased wholesale gas prices for electricity producers, as well as for small and medium-sized businesses by 20%. The wholesale selling price for gas for domestic use remained unchanged.\n\n\u201cWholesale gas prices are determined at the most reasonable level possible and offered to consumers, taking into account market and economic conditions. According to the Household Energy Price Index (HEPI), our country still has the lowest price for natural gas among European countries after Ukraine,\u201d the company notes.\n\nSince October T\u00fcrkiye has increased electricity tariffs by 20%, which creates additional pressure on the country\u2019s steel branch.\n\nLast time T\u00fcrkiye raised prices for gas in September 2022. Then tariffs increased by 50% amid increased demand due to the military aggression of Russia, the largest supplier of gas to Europe. This trend continued until the end of the year, but already in February 2023, BOTA\u015e reported a decrease in natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises by 13.3-17.2%. After that price adjustment happened in March and April \u2013 by 20.95-26.12% and 20.01%, respectively. Subsequently, tariffs remained stable.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the Turkish energy market regulator announced reduction in electricity prices for industrial consumers by 16%.\n\nSteel production in Turkiye in 2022 decreased by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons. TCUD expected a fall in production by more than 13%. During the year, steelmakers exported 19.6 million tons of steel, which is 17.7% less year-on-year. The main factors behind the decline in production are rising production costs and falling global demand for steel."

    "fullArticle": "The Turkish imported scrap market, which faced a sharp price increase on the latest bookings, continues to strengthen as suppliers are now seeking even higher prices.\n\nThe latest bookings are confirmed by a western mill at $367/t cfr for HMS 1&2 80:20 and $387/t cfr for shredded and bonus and by a Marmara mill at $372/t cfr for HMS 1&2 90:10 from the US this week.\n\nFollowing these deal, more market participants are questioning if the fundamentals behind this sharp price are solid enough. Turkish mills that have increased their steel offer prices in line with the rises seen in scrap prices are struggling to sell steel at higher levels.\n\nA Turkish mill tells Kallanish: \"There is no steel market that supports scrap prices. Stockist activity that [had] revived last week slowed again. On the other hand, premium HMS suppliers started pronouncing $375-380/t cfr levels. I don\u2019t know who can pay these levels under current conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteel demand is the key to the market. Without demand for finished steel, this increase cannot be expected to be permanent,\u201d says another mill.\n\nA supplier says: \u201cTurkey delayed purchases for a long time. Mills that need to buy are in the market and I am afraid they will have to pay higher prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkish mills\u2019 timing of returning to the scrap market has been their bad luck amid supply shortages and strong scrap demand in other regions. Further uptick is inevitable,\u201d says another supplier.\n\nA Baltic-origin supplier is heard offering HMS 1&2 80:20 at around $375/t cfr. A European supplier, however, is heard seeking $377/t cfr for the same grade while others are targeting $370/t cfr.\n\nIn the short-sea market, prices have also increased sharply this week. An Italian cargo is booked at $358/t cfr while Romanian suppliers sold at $353/t cfr, up from $325/t cfr a week earlier.\n\nWhile export demand for rebar remains lacking, domestic demand has also slowed this week compared with last week. However, amid higher scrap prices, all mills have increased their prices to $575-590/t ex-works levels. Buyers, mostly stockists, are seen to have resisted prices above $580/t."

    "fullArticle": "Turkish rebar prices, which were on a downward trend for weeks, have seen a strong recovery this week amid improved domestic demand. Export demand has also risen compared to previous weeks but is yet to reach the domestic level.\n\nTurkish mills\u2019 official offer prices stood mostly at above $630/tonne fob Turkey actual weight on Thursday. Although these are down from $640-650/t a week earlier, they have bounced back from $610-615/t fob levels early this week. Offers for mesh-quality wire rod, meanwhile, were at above $640/t fob.\n\nThe price recovery has also triggered global buyers that were halting purchases during the downtrend. Consequently, Turkish mills concluded greater tonnages of sales this week, to South America, the Middle East, the EU, the UK and Africa. However, these volumes remain far off Turkey\u2019s traditional sales in previous years and are insufficient given Turkey\u2019s production capacity.\n\nA Turkish mill tells Kallanish: \u201cAlthough we are selling rebar at $630/t fob today, mills that are relatively smaller will register losses as our average scrap cost is above $410/t.\u201d\n\nTurkish mills\u2019 conversion costs from scrap to rebar are currently diverging between $200-240/t depending on their technology and capacity.\n\nIn the domestic market, demand remained very strong on Thursday as political tension peaked. Stockists, fearing a further depreciation of the lira after the elections, are concluding purchases. Prices, which were at $645-665/t a day earlier, stood mostly at above $665/t ex-works on Thursday afternoon. Although mills sold at $657-660/t levels in the morning, they either closed sales or increased prices in the afternoon. End-user demand, however, continues to appear weak.\n\nA stockist says: \u201cThe tension is very high and stockists are buying at every price level. However, if the expected depreciation of the lira does not occur, prices are likely to fall sharply on a lira basis. This will cause stockists to record a big loss.\u201d\n\nWith Turkey starting to increase its rebar prices, the gap between it and the competition is starting to widen again. This poses a great risk for exports, which have just recovered.\n\nIn the scrap market, Turkish mills are continuing to buy HMS 1&2 80:20 at around $375/t cfr Turkey. However, amid increasing rebar prices and Turkey\u2019s demand for scrap, scrap suppliers are also likely to increase their quotes."

Kallanish reports about it.\n\nThe increase in VAT came as a surprise to market participants and added additional uncertainty. Currently, market activity is minimal due to national holidays, which leads to lower prices. Prospects for a recovery in demand after the holiday weekend are low, even at current steel price levels, and the VAT increase will require them to rise.\n\nThe Turkish scrap market was also not active last week. Mills suspended purchases of raw materials due to weak steel sales. At the same time, some European suppliers intend to increase their target offers, but Turkish steelmakers are confident that scrap prices are unlikely to increase in the near future, taking into account the situation on the steel market.\n\nThus, in the short term, Turkiye\u2019s steel market will continue to suffer from weak steel sales in both domestic and foreign markets, as the VAT increase will increase the cost of products that suffer from low competitiveness due to high production costs.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, steel enterprises of Turkiye in May 2023 increased steel production by 7.5% compared to April 2023 \u2013 up to 2.879 million tons. In January-May, 12.98 million tons of steel were produced, which is 19.1% less y/y."

    "fullArticle": "Further positive dynamics are at risk due to the potential deterioration of the Chinese economy\n\nPrices for steel raw materials are adjusted after reaching peak values \u200b\u200bin the second half of September. The coking coal market stands out from the general trend, where prices are supported by limited supply.\n\nScrap market\n\nScrap prices in Turkiye during September 28 \u2013 October 5, 2023, decreased by $4/t compared to the previous week \u2013 to $368-371/t CFR. On the Chinese market during this period, the price of raw materials did not change much \u2013 $389.51/t. In the US, as of October 6, scrap prices ranged at $345-347/t FOB compared to $343-347/t FOB a week earlier.\n\nTrade on Turkish market last week was quiet. Prices on the domestic scrap market remained stable, while import prices slightly decreased due to fresh orders from the USA. Weak activity in the market is caused by low demand for Turkish rebar in export markets. At the same time, steel sales also slowed down in the domestic market, which is the main consumer of products. Recently, local steelmakers had to raise prices for rebar due to rising electricity and gas tariffs.\n\nAmid slowing purchases of scrap on the Turkish market, European suppliers began to send raw materials to Egypt at a price of $366-367/t CFR. This shows that they are ready to sell raw materials to Turkiye at a similar price, but there is no demand yet.\n\nIn China prices remain stable, as the first decade of October is a holiday in the country, so there is no trade activity.\n\nScrap market in USA remains weak ahead of October trading amid uncertainty. While there are many factors affecting trade, two of them have the biggest impact on future prospects: the escalation of the strike in the auto industry and the resulting plant downtime.\n\nMarket participants expect high-grade scrap prices to remain at high levels, while low-grade scrap prices will decline. During September, the market saw an upward trend thanks to export demand, but no such support is expected at the moment. The strike may also affect the supply of raw materials, so a sharp collapse in prices is not predicted, but growth should not be expected either.\n\nCoking coal market\n\nCoking coal quotations in Australia for the week of September 27 \u2013 October 4, 2023, rose sharply by $27.2/t, or 8.2% \u2013 up to $358.25/t FOB. At the same time, a slight increase was observed on the Chinese market \u2013 by $2/t, or 0.7%, to $280/t.\n\nOn the one hand, the positive trend is supported by the spot market. Due to decreasing margins for steelmakers and falling steel prices, most steelmakers choose to purchase only small volumes of raw materials in the spot market, where prices are traditionally higher than in long-term contracts. On the other hand, prices are supported by tight supply as major mining companies have low volumes of cargo to trade in the fourth quarter.\n\nIron ore market\n\nThe Chinese iron ore market began a one-week holiday break on September 29. At the same time, the latest futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange traded at $116.64/t, which is 5.4% below the September peak ($123.37/t). The September growth of the market was due to the increase in imports and the decrease in port stocks. In addition, participants\u2019 mood improved due to signs of recovery in the housing sector, in particular, in the form of an increase in the issuance of new bank loans.\n\nIn general, raw materials markets showed a significant rise in September. The peak price of scrap in Turkiye was at the level of $379/t (September 11), while this level of prices was last observed at the beginning of July. Coking coal continues to grow at a rapid pace, reaching the maximum since February 2023. The iron ore market also rose through mid-September, peaking at current steel sales.\n\nThe scrap market grew due to increased purchases from Turkiye. Local steelmakers actively bought raw materials amid stable domestic demand. At the same time, China made a significant contribution to the rise of raw materials markets. Chinese steelmakers are actively ramping up steel output as the country\u2019s authorities still haven\u2019t imposed production limits in 2023.\n\nBecause Chinese steelmakers have an advantage over most competitors in the global market due to lower costs, China produces large volumes of steel. Moreover, production volumes do not correspond to domestic demand, so a significant part of steel products is sent to export markets, in particular the EU, at much cheaper prices. This, in turn, forces local producers to shut down capacity and limit production, as imports are more profitable for buyers.\n\nThus, the increase in prices for steel raw materials does not reflect the real state of the steel market.\n\n\u00abThe Chinese market is under the influence of expectations of economic stimulus from the government. However, these expectations are not supported by real actions. The incentives that have already been adopted have a prolonged effect and are unable to quickly affect the growth of demand for steel,\u00bb GMK Center analyst Andriy Glushchenko noted.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, previously the international rating agency Fitch Ratings reviewed the forecast of iron ore prices in 2023 on the upward trend \u2013 up to $110/t compared to $105/t in the previous forecast. The agency also raised its coking coal price forecast to $250/t from $220/t."

    "fullArticle": "Additional pressure on prices creates economic uncertainty in Turkiye\n\nWorld prices for scrap were mainly decreasing last week. In the Turkish market, commodity prices are likely to have bottomed out as demand rebounded after a long lull. The US market is negatively affected by the situation in Turkiye, but suppliers are trying to direct raw materials to alternative export markets. Prices are stabilizing in China as supply and demand are balanced.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap in Turkiye for the week of July 17-24, 2023, decreased by 2.7% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $351-355/t. Thus, since the beginning of the month, scrap quotations on the Turkish market have fallen by 6.6%, or $25/ton.\n\nPrices in the Turkish scrap market fell sharply on July 18, after which they stabilized. The fall was caused by a lack of demand from steelmakers, as producers faced even greater problems selling finished products on the domestic market due to higher VAT and excise taxes on fuel. In export markets, Turkish steel is not in demand due to higher prices than competitors.\n\nDuring July 19-24, after a sharp drop in scrap, Turkish steelmakers began booking imported raw materials after a week-long hold. This stabilized the quotes at $355/t. Scrap prices have probably bottomed out. Contracts at reduced prices were concluded with suppliers from the US and the Baltic States, while European traders refused to accept such price levels.\n\nDespite some activity, demand for commodities remains weak amid increased economic uncertainty in Turkiye following a series of unexpected fiscal measures, including increases in VAT and excise taxes on fuel.\n\nOn the USA market scrap prices during July 14-21 fell by 2.5% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $345-348/t. At the same time, the forecast price for July 28 is $329-334/t. Quotes of raw materials are falling, despite the expectations of market participants that prices have bottomed in June. This is mainly due to weak demand and falling prices for scrap in Turkiye, the largest export destination. Demand from Taiwan is also low.\n\nAmid current market conditions in Turkiye, some US traders are trying to funnel scrap to alternative markets, notably India. Several agreements were struck with Indian consumers last week, but no alternative market will fill the gap created by the lack of supplies to Turkiye. This greatly increases pressure on prices.\n\nOn the other hand, in the US, there is a slowdown in the rate of collection of raw materials, caused by difficult weather conditions. A scrap shortage is likely to drive up prices, or keep them stable if demand continues to weaken.\n\nIn China for the week of July 17-24, scrap prices remained almost unchanged \u2013 $396.03/t against $396.48/t. The market slowed down as supply stabilized after restrictions at some of the country\u2019s steel enterprises, as well as a seasonal decrease in demand for steel. Imported scrap metal is not of interest to Chinese consumers, as its value significantly exceeds domestic prices.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukraine in January-June 2023 increased export of scrap 3.2 times y/y \u2013 up to 92 thousand tons. Scrap collection decreased by 25.2% y/y \u2013 to 531 thousand tons. Deliveries of scrap to Ukrainian steel plants decreased by 37.2% y/y \u2013 to 413.8 thousand tons."

    "fullArticle": "Turkish rebar remain competitive in foreign markets\n\nGlobal rebar prices continued to decline last week as market sentiment remained largely negative and uncertain. Turkiye broke out of the general trend at the beginning of the current week, as domestic consumers resumed purchases after a long hold.\n\nQuotation of rebar in Turkiye, according to Kallanish, for the week of May 5-12, 2023, were stable \u2013 at the level of $610-630/t. Starting from May 15, rebar quotations began to grow and as of May 16 amounted to $615-635/t.\n\nTurkish rebar prices fell last week as international buyers showed little interest in Turkish-made products, which still struggle to compete in export markets due to high costs.\n\nThe global steel market is stagnant due to uncertainty, so Turkish producers are forced to lower prices to sell some volumes of production. Buyers, in turn, buy only those volumes of products that they need urgently.\n\nLocal producers are under pressure from financial problems in the country, including limited access to foreign currency and credit. This limits the purchase of raw materials for the production of rebar and increases the cost of finished products, which is already too high for competitiveness in export markets.\n\nAt the same time, in the period of May 16-17, 2023, the market of rebar in Turkiye began to recover. The domestic demand for products increased significantly after the first round of presidential elections in the country. Consumer-importers also began to increase purchases. Turkish rebar are sold to South America, Middle East, EU, the UK and Africa. However, these volumes are far from traditional sales in previous years and are weak compared to the available capacities.\n\nSteelmakers note that the difference between the value of scrap and rebar is insignificant, which may cause losses to small producers in the future at current price levels. In addition, the gradual increase in domestic product prices once again makes domestic products uncompetitive on export markets. This could hurt the recovery in exports, which has been flat since the beginning of the week.\n\nOn Chinese rebar market for the week of May 5-12, 2023, prices for rebar decreased by 1.9% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $503-505/t FOT. Chinese producers have been forced to cut product prices as demand for products remains weak and expectations that the market will recover after the holidays in early May have not been met.\n\nNegative market sentiment is putting pressure on prices, but buyers are staying away from purchases. The decline of the steel market provokes a drop in prices for raw materials, so end consumers wait for the bottom of the market to buy the required volumes at the most favorable price. Local traders predict that this trend will last at least until the end of May.\n\nThe main challenge for the market is supply pressure. Although local steelmakers are reducing production capacity, this is not enough to balance the market and stop the fall in prices. Instead, some of them are looking at restarting the furnaces that were shut down in April, as there is some recovery in profits, to some extent due to the drop in raw material prices.\n\nIn general, during the first half of 2023, China does not expect positive changes in the rebar market. It is expected that in May-June, product prices will be around $470/t.\n\nQuotation of rebar in USA are stable for the third week in a row \u2013 at the level of $920-940/t. Among the main factors that negatively affect the market, limiting the volume of trade \u2013 a decrease in scrap prices, an increase in interest rates, an increase in the overall cost of construction and a shortage of skilled labor in the construction industry.\n\nConstruction contractors are taking on fewer projects as their costs for building materials continue to rise. The low volume of new projects in the current construction season will make it difficult to supply large volumes of rebar and put pressure on producers as supply exceeds demand.\n\nAccording to GMK Center forecasts, closer to autumn, the global steel market will reach a balance between supply and demand. The fall in prices for raw materials and steel will stop amid increased demand. The negative scenario predicts a deepening of negative price trends.\n\n\u00abThere are well-founded fears about the banking crisis in the USA, where several large financial institutions have already gone bankrupt \u2013 it is quite possible that negative trends in the banking sector will intensify in the fall. Negative events in the American economy may occur even earlier, as negotiations on raising the national debt ceiling continue and no single solution has yet been found. In the case of a pessimistic scenario, the global economy will find itself in a state of crisis and the prices of steel and raw materials will fall even more,\u00bb it is stated in GMK Center\u2019s post.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukrainian steelmakers reduced the export of long rolled products by 17.5% compared to the previous month \u2013 to 35.95 thousand tons. In monetary terms, the export of such products fell by 13.5% m/m \u2013 to $35.31 million. The main consumers of such products were Poland, Romania, Germany and Moldova."

    "fullArticle": "In the first quarter, Turkish steelmakers reduced the shipment of products for export by 48.3%\n\nIn March 2023, steel companies of Turkiye reduced their steel exports by 52.8% compared to the same month in 2022 \u2013 to 810.6 thousand tons. This is reported by SteelOrbis with the reference to the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD).\n\nThe revenue of Turkish steelmakers from the export of steel for the month decreased by 54.3% until March 2022 \u2013 to $725.1 million.\n\nIn the first quarter, shipments of Turkish steel abroad decreased by 48.3% compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 to 2.2 million tons. The value of exports was $1.9 billion, which is 51.5% less year-on-year.\n\nAt the same time, steel imports to Turkiye increased by 42.9% y/y in March of this year \u2013 up to 1.7 million tons. In the first quarter, 4.1 million tons of steel were shipped to Turkish consumers from abroad, which is 5.9% more than in the same period of 2022.\n\nImports of flat products to the country increased by 32.2% in the first quarter, as Russia and Far Eastern countries, which export products at dumped prices, focused on the Turkish market, taking advantage of the delay in the introduction of import duties. This led to an increase in the foreign trade deficit of the Turkish steel industry and a decrease in the ratio of exports to imports.\n\nAccording to TCUD forecasts, in May 2023, the Turkish steel industry will regain its competitiveness in export markets thanks to the reduction of gas and electricity prices. Full stabilization of production and exports is expected in June.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, in March 2023, Turkiye increased its steel production by 28.9% compared to February 2023 \u2013 up to 2.713 million tons. In January-March 2023, Turkish steel companies produced 7.422 million tons of steel, which is 21.5% less compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nFrom April 1, 2023, the Turkish Oil Pipeline Corporation BOTA\u015e reduced wholesale prices on natural gas for large industrial enterprises by another 20.01% compared to March. This is the third consecutive decrease in gas prices in the country in 2023. In February, gas for industry became cheaper by 13-17%, and in March \u2013 by 21-26%\n\nAfter the last price adjustment, Turkiye has the lowest price for natural gas among European countries.\n\nAlso, Turkiye ranks eighth in the world in terms of steel production. In 2022, Turkish enterprises reduced production of steel by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons."

    "fullArticle": "Bangladesh is gearing up for a boost in crude oil imports with a new mooring facility, while Asia benzene market is seeing a slowdown in demand. Steel mills in Turkey await an interest rate decision this week amid thinning margins. In agriculture, S&P Global Commodity Insights editor focus on China's MSG exports and the price difference between animal-based and alternative meat products.\n\n1. Bangladesh's first ever single-point mooring system to allow higher Saudi, UAE crude imports\n\nWhat's happening? Bangladesh has installed its first single-point mooring system in the Bay of Bengal. Prior to the SPM installation, Bangladesh Petroleum Corp. had to use multiple small vessels to unload imported crude and oil products from large tankers anchored in deep-sea areas and move them to the state-run refiner's Chattogram storage tanks. The process used to take up to seven days to completely offload oil from a large mother tanker.\n\nWhat's next? With the new facility set to bolster logistical capacity and efficiency, Bangladesh is poised to increase Middle Eastern crude imports and diesel trades. BPC said it has already made additional Arab Light crude imports this month on expectations that the SPM facility would speed up the offloading and discharging process from late-June. The SPM system would allow BPC to offload around 900,000 barrels of crude oil within 48 hours and 600,000 barrels of diesel within 28 hours.\n\n2. Turkey export rebar demand weakens, narrowing margins with scrap costs\n\nWhat's happening? The spread between Turkey steel rebar exports and ferrous scrap imports has narrowed to around $180-$185/mt when accounting for iron content. This level was last seen in early March 2022. Turkish mills are struggling to compete with cheaper steel prices from alternative regions such as Algeria, Egypt and the UAE, while scrap prices have remained relatively supported amid lower scrap collection rates in key export regions. The situation was exacerbated by Turkish lira's weakness, which worsened mills' purchasing power, while simultaneously failing to improve export competitiveness to incentivize steel bookings. Relatively high scrap prices further reduced steel margins after adjusting for iron yields and processing costs.\n\nWhat's next? Turkish steelmakers have been more reliant on the domestic rebar market, and demand is expected to improve following a key interest rate announcement expected to be delivered on June 22. Market participants expect the decision to provide clarity on Turkey's macroeconomic policy and support investments, while helping to stabilize the Turkish lira. The London Metal Exchange scrap forward curve was largely flat at $385/mt for the June-September period as near-term price sentiment was unclear, while the Turkish rebar forward curve priced in a slight backwardation over the same period.\n\n3. Headwinds ahead for Asia benzene market\n\nWhat's happening? Demand erosion across benzene derivative products underpinned by a slow consumer market has dampened end-users' interest to replenish feedstocks. The FOB Korea benzene physical marker touched a six-month low at $749.33/mt on June 13. June is a historically strong month for Asian benzene exports, as it marks the start of the summer driving season in the US. Benzene stockpile in East China declined for the first time in nearly six months to below 200,000 mt mark but that barely enticed any traders to restock.\n\nWhat's next? The US would be closing its doors to the last batch of arbitrage benzene barrels from Asia when the summer driving season ends in the third quarter. Volumes heading to the US Gulf Coast could be minimal, filling only a sporadic demand. Expansion plans on benzene and benzene downstream units among integrated producers in China are in the pipeline, with some slated to come online by Q3, an unfavorable development to any participants currently holding on to benzene supply.\n\n4. China's MSG exports rise but prices fall 10% year-on-year\n\nWhat's happening? Export prices of China's monosodium glutamate have fallen 10% year-on-year due to strong supply amid intense domestic competition. Despite increased exports from Asia and Africa, domestic consumption has seen slow growth as the \"unhealthy\" impression of MSG has made large proportions of younger urban consumers limit their consumption. Exports to the US and EU have also been limited due to anti-dumping measures in recent years.\n\nWhat's next? Prices are expected to soften further in Q2, which can enable higher imports from Asia and Africa. However strong domestic supply will continue to put pressure on prices. The average annual growth rate of domestic consumption between 2021 and 2026 is forecasted to shrink to 1.6%, as domestic direct-to-consumer sales stagnate.\n\n5. Alternative meats approach price parity with conventional meats in France\n\nWhat's happening? Plant-based meats are reaching price parity with conventional meats in France, as high inflation continues to impact the prices of animal-based meats, according to market research institute Xerfi. Meat alternative prices fell despite overall food price inflation, due to increased economies of scale and the compression of margins. Between 2020-2023, Beyond Meat's burger prices fell 40%, while S&P Global Commodity Insight's price for French minced beef steak rose 41%, with the two approaching price parity.\n\nWhat's next? Beyond Meat is apparently on track to achieve its commitment of having at least one product at price parity with animal meat by 2024, with other suppliers likely in a similar position. Price parity between conventional and plant-based meats will drive consumption of plant-based meat, as many consumers are either unwilling or unable to bridge the existing price gap between the two.\n\nLearn more: S&P Global Commodity Insights Agribusiness\n\nReporting by Phil Vahn, Sue Koh, Abdi Salad, Mark Chooi Kim Weng, Eugene Ong"

Thus, Turkish steelmakers increased steel production to its highest level since June 2022. This is evidenced by data published on the World Steel Association website.\n\nCompared to October last year, Turkish steelmakers increased steel production by 4.1% in October 2023.\n\nIn January-October 2023, Turkish steelmakers produced 27.45 million tons of steel, down 8.8% compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nThe average monthly steel production in Turkey in January-October 2023 amounted to 2.74 million tons, down 8.76% y/y.\n\nSince October 2023, Turkiye has increased wholesale natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises by 20% compared to August. In addition, the country raised electricity tariffs by 20%, which puts additional pressure on the country\u2019s steel industry.\n\nThe last time Turkiye raised natural gas prices was in September 2022. At that time, tariffs increased by 50% amid rising demand due to the military aggression of Russia, the largest gas supplier to Europe. This trend continued until the end of the year, but in February 2023, BOTA\u015e announced a 13.3-17.2% reduction in natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises. This was followed by price adjustments in March and April \u2013 by 20.95-26.12% and 20.01%, respectively. The tariffs remained stable thereafter.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the Turkish energy market regulator announced a 16% reduction in electricity prices for industrial consumers.\n\nSteel production in Turkiye in 2022 decreased by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons. TCUD expected production to fall by more than 13%. Over the year, the steelmakers exported 19.6 million tons of steel, down 17.7% y/y. The main factors behind the decline were rising production costs and a drop in global steel demand."

European gas prices are stabilising more and more. And the global stainless steel market continues to warm up.\n\nEC extends anti-dumping measure to stainless steel from Turkey\n\nThe European Commission (EC) has announced the results of the anti-circumvention investigation against imports of certain hot rolled stainless steel sheets and coils originating in Indonesia to imports of certain hot rolled stainless steel sheets and coils consigned from T\u00fcrkiye, whether declared as originating in Turkey or not.\n\nAnti-dumping duties at 17.3\n\nAs already expected, the EC comes to the final conclusion that circumvention of the anti-dumping measure against SSHR from Indonesia via Turkey has taken place and thus extends the measure to Turkey. Henceforth, 17.3% anti-dumping duties will be imposed on corresponding products from Turkey.\n\nThe EC rejected requests for an exemption from some Turkish exporters.\n\nEuropean natural gas prices continue to stabilise\n\nNatural gas prices stabilize as European natural gas delivery for one month dropped to approximately 42 euros per megawatt hour on the Dutch TTF.\n\nLow gas consumption in March\n\nThis decline is attributed to a decrease in gas consumption in the European Union (EU) in March, which was 18 percent below the seasonal five-year average. As a result, the storage stocks in the EU were filled to 56.2 percent of total capacity at the end of the heating season, the highest level in over a decade. The EU aims to fill storage facilities to at least 90 percent by the end of October, which requires approximately 28 billion cubic meters of natural gas, significantly less than last summer\u2019s 39 billion cubic meters acquired from non-Russian sources.\n\nFurther decline in inflation expected\n\nWith current import levels, the storage facilities are expected to be filled by the end of August, keeping natural gas prices lower than last summer. This has positive economic effects by reducing inflation and easing the burden on energy-intensive industries.\n\nGlobal stainless steel market is warming up\n\nIn the meantime, other media also report that the global stainless steel market is showing signs of warming up as several regions in Asia, including Taiwan, have increased their stainless steel prices in response to the recent pickup in China\u2019s market. This positive momentum is expected to expand to the European and North American markets in the near future.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s stainless steel prices have followed rebound\n\nSpot market prices for stainless steel in China, as well as Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) stainless futures, have been rising for several days, and nickel prices in both Europe and Asia have also increased, indicating a gradually stronger price tendency in the global markets. Taiwan\u2019s stainless steel prices have followed suit with the prices rebounding in China.\n\nLatest news"

Metal Expert reports about it with the reference to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK).\n\nIn March 2023, the volume of billets imported into the country amounted to 376.15 thousand tons, which is 4 times more in annual terms.\n\nTurkish rolling companies preferred foreign products to local products due to more attractive prices. In addition, the country increased its imports in March compared to February, when operations in the steel sector were affected by the earthquake.\n\nThe main supplier of semi-finished products to Turiyey remained the Russian Federation. In January-March 2023, the country imported 368.5 thousand tons of Russian billet (+94.7% y/y). At the same time, the share of imports from the MENA region is growing on the Turkish market, exceeding the share of the CIS. In the first quarter, imports from the countries of this region amounted to 468,000 tons, which is 49% of the total volume. Algeria and Oman took the second and the third places among the exporting countries, and Kuwait, which was not previously represented, was also included in the top 5 suppliers.\n\nIn March, MENA provided half of the total billet imports, putting 186.3 thousand tons on the Turkish market.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Turkiye in February 2023 diversified import of slabs. The supply of Russian products to the country in February 2023 fell by 62.6% y/y. Local plants used not only products from the Russian Federation, but also bought European semi-finished products. According to TUIK, in general, in February 2023, the volume of import of slabs to the country doubled compared to January \u2013 to 155.7 thousand tons. Compared to the same period last year, it decreased by 25.2%."

    "fullArticle": "The capacity expansion project began in 2021\n\nFrom July 2023, the Turkish steel company Colakoglu Metalurji will increase its capacity for the production of hot-rolled products to 4.5 million tons per year. This was announced by the company\u2019s executive director Ugur Dalbeler, writes Kallanish.\n\nThe capacity expansion project began in 2021 and will be launched next month amid pressure from Asian imports. Currently, the company\u2019s annual production capacity is 3.2 million tons of steel, approximately 3 million tons of hot-rolled products, and 600,000 tons of rebar.\n\nAccording to Ugur Dalbeler, the Turkish steel industry is currently facing problems related to heavy dumping, particularly from China. Chinese imports of HRC into the region have grown strongly over the past three quarters. The influx of cheap steel from the People\u2019s Republic of China has affected the Turkish steel industry, forcing it to cut production by up to 20%.\n\nThe subsidies received by Chinese steel producers and the fact that the factories are state-owned allow them to offer prices $100-150/t below market prices. In addition, since the middle of last year, Turkiye\u2019s steel industry has been under pressure from importers from the Far East and Southeast Asia. Ugur Dalbeler noted that the combination of protectionist measures from Western countries and unfair competition from the East makes it difficult for Turkish steelmakers to invest in production and maintain existing operations.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, one of the leading Turkish producers of steel profiles is Kocaer Celik resumed production at its Alia\u011fa A2 plant after modernization. The company aims to further increase sales and export volumes.\n\nAlso, Turkish steel producers are calling again to limit imports of steel products. The volume of steel imports to the country for January-April 2003 increased by 11.9% y/y. The increase in imports was largely due to the arrival of Far Eastern countries, which have advantages in the cost of production, to the Turkish market."

    "fullArticle": "Price optimism in the first quarter of 2023 did not find its confirmation in the future\n\nAfter the second half of 2022 , which was a period of low steel prices, steelmakers hoped for a better situation this year. Partially, their optimism was justified, but not for long.\n\nPrice decline\n\nStarting around the end of March, there has been a significant decline in prices for steel and raw materials on world markets. For various positions, rolled steel prices fell by $50-70/t. Global prices for HRC are declining due to weak demand. Sales decreased due to negative market sentiment under the influence of uncertainty in the Chinese market and negative macroeconomic factors.\n\nEuropean producers react accordingly to the negative price environment. In January-March 2023, German steelmakers reduced steel production by 6.65% y/y \u2013 to 9.16 million tons, while their French counterparts produced 2.33 million tons of steel, which is 32% less compared to the same period last year. Italy in the first quarter reduced steel production by 6% compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 to 5.63 million tons.\n\nEuropean companies have to compete with cheap imports in their own markets. According to GMK Center, the gap between European hot-rolled steel prices and Asian import offers is becoming dangerously large and volatile. This situation in the short term may lead to lower prices for European products. If demand does not recover in May, which is unlikely given the economic instability, Italian hot-rolled steel prices could fall to \u20ac750-770/t.\n\nFactors that affect pricing in the steel market:\n\nGlobal geopolitical uncertainty and continued policy of central banks to raise key rates. Weak recovery of construction sector in China \u2013 the peak season was predicted for March-April. Soon the PRC will be covered by the rainy season, which will reduce the consumption of steel products, so the outlook for the iron ore market is still unfavorable. Until May 28 \u2013 the day of the second round of the presidential elections in Turkiye \u2013 the situation in this regional market will be highly uncertain. In addition, domestic demand weakened due to the sharp devaluation of the lira. However, after the election, the situation with steel sales and scrap purchases will remain unchanged, as there are more serious problems, in particular, the lack of foreign exchange and the unavailability of credit. Significant pressure on prices will come from the commissioning of facilities previously affected by the fire. ArcelorMittal in Dunkirk plans to resume production at BF \u21164 in mid-June. There have been fires at ArcelorMittal facilities in the EU, which may provoke a shortage of hot-rolled steel in the EU market at the level of 1 million tons. Technical problems at Tata Steel\u2019s European facilities should also be noted. Consumers are pursuing a cautious policy of purchases, expecting an even greater reduction in prices for steel products. Fears about a banking crisis in the US, where several large financial institutions have already gone bankrupt.\n\nTata Steel expects improvement of the situation in Europe in July-September. This is due to lower energy costs. Company may consider closing a significant part of operations in the UK if it fails to obtain appropriate financial support from the government within the next two years.\n\nAccording to World Bank estimates, this year, despite growth in the first quarter, the fastest drop in global commodity prices since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected. Base steel prices are expected to fall by 8% in 2023 and another 3% in 2024. This will inevitably affect the quotations of ferrous metals downward.\n\nRaw materials markets\n\nThe uncertain situation in the steel markets leads to lower prices for raw materials:\n\nScrap.\n\nWorld scrap prices continued to decline amid weak demand for steel and uncertainty about the economic outlook. The fall in steel prices is forcing steelmakers to refuse to purchase raw materials in order not to incur losses. Scrap prices in Turkiye are moving to $360/t. With no demand from Turkish steelmakers and steel prices continuing to fall, the market expects a possible reduction in scrap prices in the short term.\n\nIron ore.\n\nIron ore price continues declining amid growing concerns about a possible drop in demand in China, as the country\u2019s authorities may amid growing concerns about a possible drop in demand in China, as the country\u2019s authorities may limit steel production of 2022 level. Iron ore prices remain under pressure from declining demand caused by a prolonged decline in production at some Chinese steel plants. Some companies carry out equipment repairs during period of uncertainty in the market so as not to incur more significant losses.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts All this will negatively affect the already weak domestic demand, despite the peak of the construction season in the country. In the second decade of April, iron ore prices fell to a four-month low of $107/t.analysts predict that iron ore price will average $90/t in the second half of 2023 amid reduced steel production in China and demand for it. In the near term, iron ore prices in China are likely to continue to decline as weak demand for steel coupled with a gradual increase in supply creates a negative trend for the market.\n\nCoking coal.\n\nIn the recent times, global prices for coking coal have been falling amid low activity of buyers. Raw material quotations for only one week of April decreased by 7%. Analysts predict that availability of Australian coking coal will improve within a few months due to favorable weather conditions. Earlier, S&P Global analysts expected falling prices for coking coal.\n\nGlobal hopes\n\nA positive signal for the market was the growth of China\u2019s GDP in the first quarter at the level of 4.5% y/y, which exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts by 0.5 percentage points. Analysts at JPMorgan and Citi improved their forecast for China\u2019s GDP growth in 2023 to 6.4% and 6.1% from 6% and 5.7% respectively.\n\nSignificant growth in Chinese retail became one of the key drivers of GDP growth for the quarter. This indicator was highest since June 2021 \u2013 10.6% y/y in March against the expected 7.4% y/y, for the first quarter \u2013 5.76% y/y.\n\nAt the same time, there are also negative trends in the Chinese economy:\n\nin April, all PMI (NBS) indexes unexpectedly fell, and the industry went below 50 points;\n\nexports in April amounted to $295.5 billion (8.5% y/y) compared to $315.6 billion (14.8% y/y) in March;\n\nApril imports amounted to $205.3 billion (-7.9% y/y) compared to $227.4 billion (-1.4% y/y) in March.\n\nThe slowdown in exports is primarily an indicator of weak global demand, while the decline in imports is an indicator of suppressed domestic demand in China.\n\nOverall, according to Fitch, the global economy started 2023 better than expected. This was due to the high pace of development in China and the largest economies \u2013 in January-March, the US economy increased by 0.3% against the forecast of 0.4%, the Eurozone \u2013 by 0.1%, which is at the level of expectations.\n\nUkrainian realities\n\nUkrainian producers of both steel and raw materials track trends in foreign markets. Price driver \u2013 expectations for the level of demand. A slight decline is expected on the key EU market for the Ukrainian iron and steel products. According to the Association of European Steel Producers (EUROFER) estimates, apparent steel consumption in 2023 will fall by 1%. This indicator in the EU at the end of 2022 decreased by 7.2% y/y.\n\nIn turn, the World Steel Association WorldSteel (WSA) expects that the demand for steel in EU and the UK in 2023 will amount to 151.3 million tons, which is 0.4% lower than in 2022. At the same time, according to WSA estimates, global demand for steel will grow by 2.3% y/y in 2023 \u2013 up to 1.82 billion tons.\n\nIn turn, the National Bank of Ukraine predicts a long period (until the third quarter of 2025) of a decline in world prices for steel products. A slight increase in steel and iron ore prices in 2023 is associated with Turkiye\u2019s recovery from the consequences of the earthquake in early February 2023. At the same time, we can hardly expect a significant improvement in the price situation for scrap, especially in summer.\n\nTurkish steel producers at current scrap prices are losing competition in the European market: quotations for rebar from Turkish plants are higher than from other producers. Turkish plants refuse to purchase scrap and put pressure on suppliers to reach an acceptable and competitive price level. The search for balance will take time and the fall in scrap prices may continue for the next 2-3 months.\n\nThis assumption looks especially realistic amid the dynamics of steel production in China. In fact, the price of scrap is largely determined by the price of iron ore, as steel products made from scrap and products made from iron ore compete with each other in the market. China sets the trend for iron ore prices to fall, thus indirectly influencing the scrap market.\n\nGMK Center sees two possible scenarios for further market dynamics. First scenario \u2013 closer to autumn, the global steel market will come to a balance between supply and demand. Falling prices for raw materials and steel will stop amid increased demand.\n\nAntonio Marcegaglia, Chairman of the Marcegaglia Group board, has a similar opinion. He believes that until July the flow of orders for European plants will be slow and small, while in September we can expect demand to pick up.\n\nIn the event of the appearance of \u00abblack swans\u00bb, second (pessimistic) scenario with deepening negative price trends may appear. Reasonable fears are expressed about the banking crisis in the US, where several large financial institutions have already gone bankrupt \u2013 it is quite possible that negative trends in the banking sector will intensify in autumn. Negative events in the US economy may come earlier, as negotiations to raise the debt ceiling continue and no single solution has yet been found. In the case of a pessimistic scenario, the global economy will be in a crisis and the prices of steel and raw materials will fall even more."

Rebar purchases in Turkiye have slowed down due to uncompetitive price levels in export markets, the Chinese market has weakened amid weak demand, and in the US risks of a decrease in rebar purchases by the construction sector are growing due to macroeconomic problems.\n\nQuotation of rebar in Turkiye, according to Kallanish data, for the week of April 7-14, 2023, decreased by 1.4% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $675-685/t.\n\nTurkish rebar prices fell for the sixth consecutive week amid weak export demand, which is constrained by low competitiveness of local products. In addition, market activity decreased last week due to the holidays.\n\nSome market participants believe that in order to meet export demand, Turkish steelmakers should reduce prices for rebar to the level of competitors. As prices in these markets also fall, the maximum operating level for Turkish rebar is around $660/t.\n\nA slight reduction in quotations would allow buyers from the EU, Israel and Yemen to choose Turkish products because of advantages in terms of order fulfillment and quality.\n\nA new challenge for Turkish plants has become Chinese exporters, who offer EU buyers rebar at $650/t, including delivery. A further decline in the Chinese market could trigger more serious consequences for Turkiye, as local steelmakers cannot afford such price levels given current production costs.\n\nDomestic demand was also weak due to the devaluation of the lira. Local traders have suspended purchases of rebar as the volatility of the local currency threatens their incomes. Everyone buys only the most necessary volumes of products, so prices also go down. Plants are forced to make discounts, but this does not cause a critical blow to their incomes, since the country\u2019s authorities have recently reduced the prices of energy resources.\n\nTurkish rebar is expected to continue to fall in the short term due to weak demand in both export and domestic markets. Almost all Turkish plants are willing to negotiate to fill the order book, which is quite empty. Export prices that are acceptable for producers are currently $670/t, but if the volumes are greater than 10,000 tons, the price level may be lower.\n\nOn Chinese rebar market negative trends are also observed. As of April 14, 2023, product prices were $564-567/t FOT, which is 2.6% lower compared to April 7.\n\nChina rebar quotations fell for a second week in a row as demand for the product continues to decrease while supply remains high. The pressure of low demand in the domestic and export markets forces producers to reduce prices, but this does not produce results.\n\nSome steel companies are already curtailing production to balance supply and demand and avoid a significant drop in product quotations and margins. Market participants are uncertain about demand until the end of April and expect the market to be volatile in May-June. A rebound in prices is expected in the second half of the year.\n\nQuotation of rebar in USA are stable for the third week in a row \u2013 at the level of $950-970/t. Prices have frozen as market sentiment has remained weak since the second half of March. Despite strong domestic demand, the construction sector has faced headwinds: tight budgets and rising interest rates are weighing on the completion of projects and market sentiment.\n\nCurrently, rebar prices in the States may be affected by the scrap market, which is volatile due to a slowdown in global markets and a drop in demand from Turkish consumers.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukrainian steelmakers in March 2023 have increased export of long rolled products by 46.2% compared to the previous month \u2013 up to 43.6 thousand tons. In monetary terms, the export of such products increased by 53.9% m/m \u2013 up to $40.8 million. The main consumers of such products were Poland, Romania, Germany and Moldova."

    "fullArticle": "Activity in the Turkish and Chinese markets picked up as commodity prices reached operational levels\n\nWorld prices for scrap continued to fall during the past week, although some positive signals are already visible in the market. In particular, Turkish steelmakers have started to replenish raw material stocks amid sharp increase in domestic demand for steel. Chinese steelmakers have achieved optimal margins from sales of steel products at the expense of low raw material prices \u2013 accordingly, we can expect that the pressure on raw material prices from China will weaken.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap in Turkiye for the week of May 8-15, 2023, decreased by 2.3% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $374-376/t.\n\nPrices for imported raw materials on the Turkish market last week continued to decline for the fifth week in a row. Suppliers are forced to gradually reduce the margin from scrap sales in order to restore the interest of Turkish steelmakers in the purchase of raw materials.\n\nLast week was marked by a revival of raw material purchases by local steelmakers, as domestic demand for steel began to rise sharply. This gave impetus to active scrap contracting for June. Agreements were concluded with European and American suppliers.\n\nThe recovery of domestic demand for steel has allowed steelmakers to increase activity in scrap purchases, but uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election continues to weigh on the market. Based on this, the plants will cover only urgent needs and avoid large contracts.\n\nIn addition, a significant problem for the purchase of imported scrap is the fall in the exchange rate of the lira against foreign currencies. Plants face restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency and cannot pay for scrap. It also inhibits trade.\n\nSome market participants expect that after the Turkish election, scrap prices will recover slightly and the market will see another round of purchases. At the same time, some of them predict a suspension of demand, as many contracts were signed last week, and Turkiye has a 9-day holiday in June.\n\nChinese market last week also saw a decrease in scrap prices \u2013 by 1%, to $391.69/t.\n\nDuring the week of May 8-15, 2023, the capacity utilization level of plants operating on electric arc furnaces remained at the level of the previous week \u2013 up to 52%. Average daily scrap deliveries to the country\u2019s steel enterprises increased by 15% \u2013 up to 473.7 thousand tons, and average daily consumption \u2013 by 1.2%, up to 455.5 thousand tons. Steel plants restored the profitability of steel production after a sharp drop in raw material prices, which led to an increase in steel output and an increase in demand for scrap.\n\nImported scrap is not interesting for Chinese producers, as domestic prices are much lower than foreign offers. In addition, Chinese scrap quality standards are stricter than international ones. Currently, import offers are $390/t.\n\nOn the USA market for the week of May 5-12, 2023, scrap prices fell by 6.3% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $350-354/t. The dynamics of the US market match the trends of the Turkish market, as US scrap suppliers depend on exports to Turkiye.\n\nAfter a long fall in raw material prices, demand has finally recovered as Turkish steelmakers have tapped into international markets. At the same time, it is noted that supply still outweighs demand, which may continue the downward trend in prices.\n\nMost market participants are still undecided on the outlook for June trading, as Turkiye\u2019s presidential election carries a lot of uncertainty. Since the first round of elections did not determine the winner, the country will hold a second round scheduled for the end of May. This negatively affects market activity and the confidence of its participants.\n\n\u00abAt the current level of scrap prices, Turkish steel producers will lose competition on the European market: quotations of Turkish plants for rebars are higher than those of other producers. Turkish plants refuse to buy scrap and put pressure on suppliers to reach an acceptable and competitive price level. The search for equilibrium will take time, and in the next 2-3 months, the drop in scrap prices may continue,\u00bb notes the GMK Center analyst Andriy Glushchenko.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Ukraine in January-April 2023 increased the export of scrap 7.9 times per year \u2013 up to 56.4 thousand tons. Scrap production decreased by 40.8% y/y \u2013 to 366.6 thousand tons. Scrap supplies to Ukrainian steel plants decreased by 49.8% y/y \u2013 to 292.8 thousand tons."

    "fullArticle": "Scrap quotations on the Turkish market for the week of March 20-27, 2023, decreased by $16/t\n\nLast week, steel scrap prices continued to fall on international markets. The decrease in purchases of raw materials by Turkish consumers has a negative impact on world markets for the second week in a row.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap on the Turkish market, according to Kallanish, during March 20-27, 2023, fell by $16/t, or by 3.5%, compared to the previous week \u2013 to $441-444/t.\n\nCommodity quotations on the Turkish market have been falling for the past two weeks as scrap supply outstrips demand. Local steelmakers stay away from purchasing raw materials due to weak steel sales. Low demand for rebar in both the domestic and export markets is putting pressure on prices, forcing mills to stop buying scrap.\n\nThe suppliers, in their turn, are sure that the Turkish steelmakers have not yet completely closed the need for scrap for April, so they are trying not to succumb to pressure. In addition, the confidence of scrap collectors is reinforced by the low rates of raw material collection in the EU and the USA.\n\nMost market participants believe that a downtrend in such circumstances is more likely than an uptrend. Some of them expect a drop in the price of scrap by another $10-15/t in the short term \u2013 at the level of $430/t.\n\nAt the same time, while Turkish steelmakers are refusing purchases, trying to reduce the prices of raw materials as much as possible, suppliers from the United States are directing cargo that was planned to be delivered to Turkiye to alternative markets. This may lead to a jump in scrap prices for Turkish steelmakers in the future.\n\nThe price of scrap metal in the European Union is also falling under the influence of the Turkish factor. In Italy scrap prices last week fell by \u20ac10-20/t compared to the price at the beginning of March. Currently, raw material quotations vary from \u20ac380/t to \u20ac440/t, depending on the grade.\n\nEU scrap prices are likely to be slightly lower or flat in April as demand from steel mills is expected to be strong, but uncertainty in the steel market will hold back purchases. Steelmakers may resort to production shutdowns to balance the supply and demand of finished products.\n\nSentiments in the USA market also suffered due to the low activity of Turkish buyers. The participants did not expect a downward trend, as they were confident in the demand from Turkiye. On the East Coast of the United States, scrap prices last week were at $414-419/t compared to $436-441/t a week earlier. Local traders do not foresee a recovery in prices in the near term, as Turkish demand will not recover until steel quotes are stable.\n\nPrices for scrap in China last week also decreased. As of March 24, East China raw material prices were 3.04 thousand yuan/t ($442/t), down 95 yuan/t from a week earlier. The negative situation in the steel market forced local steelmakers to reduce production and reduce scrap consumption.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in January-February 2023 decreased by 70.8% compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 to 152.2 thousand tons. The export of raw materials during this period amounted to 24.8 thousand tons, which is 3.5 times more y/y, and import \u2013 0.04 thousand tons (-60% y/y)."

    "fullArticle": "The level of gas prices in Turkiye may balance with the cost of energy resources in the EU already in June of this year\n\nThe electricity costs of Turkish steel mills will continue to fall in the coming months after a sharp increase in 2022, which negatively affected the export competitiveness of local producers. This was stated by the head of the Turkish Union of Steel Exporters (CIB) Adnan Aslan, reports S&P Global.\n\n\u201c1 thousand cubic meters of natural gas in the Netherlands now costs \u20ac42. As of April 1, 2022, prices in Turkiye are planned to be reduced to \u20ac50, with the possibility of further adjustment. The cost of gas will still be higher than in the EU, but the prices may balance with the European level already in June of this year,\u201d Aslan said.\n\nFormer President of Turiyey Recep Erdogan announced that the wholesale price of natural gas for industry will be reduced by 20% from April 1, 2023. Electricity prices for all consumers will decrease by 15%.\n\nAccording to CIB, in 2022 electricity prices in Turkiye increased sharply and accounted for 27% of the production costs of steel plants against 8% in 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite the decrease in energy costs of plants in recent months, the volume of steel exports by producers may decrease by approximately 40% in 2023 due to low global demand. In 2022, Turkish steelmakers reduced product exports by 20% \u2013 to 21 million tons,\u201d the CIB chairman added.\n\nTo limit the possible drop in exports in 2023, CIB is organizing trade visits to major and potential export markets with the aim of strengthening commercial ties between countries and trade volumes.\n\nFrom January to February 2023, Turkiye reduced its steel exports by 40%, but according to Adnan Aslan, the devastating earthquakes that occurred in the country during this period did not have a noticeable impact on the work of steelmakers.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, in September 2022, Turkiye raised prices for electricity and gas for industry by 50%. The regulatory agency linked the rise in electricity prices to the rise in energy prices, especially under the influence of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe high cost of energy resources caused growth cost of share on electricity and gas in Turkish steel sector up to 28-30% of the total costs in steel production. Steel capacity utilization dropped from 75% to less than 60% as producers cut shifts or shut down operations.\n\nAlready at the end of December 2022, the regulator of the energy market of Turkiye announced about reduction of electricity prices for industrial consumers by 16%. The agency also lowered the maximum price for electricity on the free market from 4.8 thousand liras/MWh to 4.2 thousand liras/MWh.\n\nFrom February 1, 2023, the Turkish Oil Pipeline Corporation (BOTA\u015e) is reducing wholesale prices for natural gas for large industrial enterprises by 13.3-17.2% compared to October 2022. In February, the company reduced the cost of gas by another 20.95-26.12%."

    "fullArticle": "Chinese producers maintain a price advantage, India cannot withstand competition with China\n\nThe level of price export offers on the global steel market in June 2023 decreased compared to previous months. SteelMint informs about it.\n\nMonthly average Chinese hot rolled coil (HRC) offers in June fell 2% from May, or $13/t, to $554/t FOB, while offers from Indian mills fell 5% m/m \u2013 to $568/t FOB. The price of Turkish reference rebar in this period fell by $6/t compared to May \u2013 to $630/t.\n\nA number of factors influenced the level of offers on the global market. First of all, there is still a lack of sufficient demand for steel in the leading economies, which forces producers to constantly reduce export prices. Demand from end consumers is affected by inflation and energy prices, which, although decreasing, still have a negative effect.\n\nChina is currently using its price advantage. Domestic demand is not growing as expected, global signals are muted, so Chinese steel mills will cut export offerings in an effort to capture markets. At the same time, the region of the Middle East and East Africa was opened to low prices. In addition, restrictions are being implemented in the country, which are slowing down production, and the market is waiting for new government measures to stimulate the economy.\n\nIndian producers cannot compete with Chinese offerings. In addition, domestic demand was also depressed, so plants and traders cut prices for June.\n\nTurkish exports of rebar also fell significantly. Domestic demand is expected to increase to cover reconstruction demand after the February 2023 earthquake, as well as to upgrade buildings in other parts of the country. However, this will not be enough to make the Turkish steel mills feel more confident. In addition, they are under pressure from the recent upward trend in scrap prices and the weakening of the Turkish lira.\n\nAt the same time, the Fitch Ratings agency reviewed its forecast regarding the global steel sector from impaired to neutral. This is underpinned by stronger-than-expected figures from China, although demand from key steel-consuming sectors is uneven. On the manufacturing side, it fluctuates, although the purchasing managers\u2019 index points to a recovery, on the real estate sector it is falling and is forecast to remain weak. Stronger-than-expected infrastructure growth and a seasonal pick-up in construction in the third quarter of 2023 will boost steel demand. Production volumes are likely to remain stable. This, together with the correction of raw material prices, will increase the margins of Chinese producers.\n\nIn Europe, rising energy prices led to muted industrial activity in the second half of 2022, while high steel inventories led to capacity cuts. Some of these assets are returning to the market amid improved sentiment and in anticipation of a restocking cycle. Although the recovery in steel demand in Europe remains fragile, producers\u2019 profit per tonne is acceptable thanks to contracts with more stable prices. Prices were also supported by supply-side disruptions.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, WorldSteel predicts recovery of global demand for steel in 2023 by 2.3%."

This was stated by the Secretary General of the Turkish Steel Association (TCUD) Veysel Yayan, Argus.Media reports.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s steel mills are negatively affected by low steel demand and weak margins.\n\nThe global steel capacity utilization rate for the period was 75.3%, up from 74.3% in January-October last year.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s steel production in January-October fell by 8.8% y/y \u2013 to 27.5 million tons. The decline reflects the shutdown of steel mills after the February earthquakes and high energy prices in the first half of the year.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s steel exports fell to 7.5 million tons in January-September, down from 12.4 million tons a year earlier. At the same time, steel imports to the country are growing \u2013 Turkiye is now a net importer of steel products from the EU and the fourth largest importer in the world.\n\n\u00abThe import of flat rolled products in January-September amounted to 6.7 million tons. These volumes satisfied almost half of Turkiye\u2019s demand for flat rolled products, which increased this year,\u00bb commented Veysel Yayan.\n\nSince October 2023, Turkiye has increased wholesale natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises by 20% compared to August. In addition, the country raised electricity tariffs by 20%, which puts additional pressure on the country\u2019s steel industry.\n\nThe last time Turkiye raised natural gas prices was in September 2022. At that time, tariffs increased by 50% amid rising demand due to the military aggression of Russia, the largest gas supplier to Europe. This trend continued until the end of the year, but in February 2023, BOTA\u015e announced a 13.3-17.2% reduction in natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises. This was followed by price adjustments in March and April \u2013 by 20.95-26.12% and 20.01%, respectively. Subsequently, tariffs remained stable.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, steel production in Turkiye in 2022 decreased by 12.9% compared to 2021 to 35.1 million tons. TCUD expected a drop in production of more than 13%. Over the year, steelmakers exported 19.6 million tons of steel, down 17.7% y/y. The main factors behind the decline in production are rising production costs and falling global steel demand."

    "fullArticle": "The rise in scrap, iron ore and hot rolled coil prices amid a notable demand absence from end-users, specifically in the EU and Turkey, has impacted overall demand for pig iron, market participants inform Kallanish.\n\nReports regarding potential EU measures on Russia-origin pig iron have led some customers to delay their purchasing decisions, even though they are doubtful about the likelihood of such an imposition due to its negative impact on EU industry. Some market participants suggest this announcement might prompt immediate purchases in the EU, assuming the usual grace period would be provided. However, this assumption remained unconfirmed as no deals were reported, contributing to increased uncertainty surrounding price trends.\n\nIn Russia, the additional burden resulting from the export duty, coupled with the strengthening of the rouble, has reportedly increased the pig iron breakeven point to approximately $380-400/tonne fob Black Sea, according to Russian producers.\n\nThe exchange rate signalled a duty at around 5.5% for December and potentially 4.5% for January, according to market participants\u2019 estimates. The export duty is at zero if the exchange rate is at RUB 80/dollar or lower, 4% if at RUB 80-85; 4.5% if at RUB 85-90; 5.5% if at RUB 90-95; and 7% if over RUB 95.\n\nIn Italy, quotes from Russian producers were at $395-415/t cfr, whereas the most recent transactions were recorded at $380-390/t cfr for end-December boarding. Italian mills are buying limited volumes at around $410/t delivered from distributors. The stronger euro against the dollar could enhance the material's attractiveness.\n\n\u201cTurkey's market had shown recent activity [in buying pig iron]; however, the current demand has reached a saturation point,\u201d a Russian producer source says. Despite the increased prices for scrap and flat steel in Turkey, weak export sales of finished steel are adversely affecting demand for imported pig iron in the country, he adds.\n\nThe producer source evaluates the market at $370-380/t cfr Italy and $390-400/t cfr Turkey. Considering the recent surge in scrap prices, there is a possibility that feasible prices might rise some $10/t or possibly more, he adds.\n\nThere were rumours on testing prices in China at $430/t cfr and sales to India at $375/t fob Black Sea; however, this was not largely confirmed at the time of publication.\n\nThese markets are believed to potentially become targeted markets in the event of sanctions on pig iron in the EU. Additionally, there were reports of India announcing a pig iron tender for exports. Market participants speculated that China could be a potential destination, although no price indications were provided.\n\nAs a result, Russian pig iron prices were assessed at $350-375/t fob Black Sea, widening from $360-370/t fob last week.\n\nThere have been reports of significant increases in Brazilian slab prices for the US market, which could eventually impact prices of pig iron in Brazil. Brazilian PI was quoted at around $422-426/t fob with availability from January shipment. However, one source suggests that offers for February and March were presently available, with current offers at the high end of the price range.\n\nIn the US, \u201cHRC is strong and price of busheling is anticipated to continue rising until January. By the latter half of the year, scrap is expected to experience structural tightness,\u201d a trader says."

    "fullArticle": "Steelmakers are refusing to buy scrap because they are unsure of future steel sales\n\nThe global scrap market showed negative dynamics last week as apparent demand for steel remains low. Steel companies are forced to stop for maintenance and reduce production, thereby putting pressure on scrap prices.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap in Turkiye for the week of April 17-24, 2023, fell by 3.7% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $410-415/t. Scrap demand among Turkish steel mills remains subdued amid weak market sentiment, low steel consumption and uncertainty ahead of the country\u2019s upcoming presidential election. Additional pressure on the market is created by the daily depreciation of the lira against the dollar.\n\nThe pressure of active Chinese steel exports continues to create negative terms of trade for Turkish steelmakers. Cheap Asian steel makes the products of Turkish steelmakers uncompetitive on the global market, and there is also no domestic demand for steel.\n\nAccording to market participants, after the elections, the situation with steel sales and scrap purchases will remain unchanged, as there are more serious problems, in particular, the lack of foreign currency and the unavailability of loans. Some plants are already reducing capacity utilization and, at the same time, the need for scrap.\n\nIn the short term, demand for scrap and steel sales is not expected to improve, at least until May 14 \u2013 for the elections.\n\nPrices for Chinese scrap market last week also fell sharply \u2013 by 17.3%, to $414.7/t. The negative dynamics are associated with the shutdown of local steel plants for maintenance, as well as the fall in the margins of producers working on electric arc furnaces (EAF). As a result, during April 14-21, 2023, plants with EAFs used 66.4% of their production capacity, which is 11.9 percentage points less than the previous week.\n\nThe average daily volume of scrap supplies to all steel enterprises amounted to 287,000 tons, which is 6.8% less compared to the week of April 7-14. The average daily consumption of raw materials fell by 2.5% \u2013 to 315,000 tons.\n\nTo reduce price pressure amid weak demand, Chinese steel companies have begun maintenance on their facilities and are cutting production. In addition, the consumption of scrap is reduced amid power outages that are caused by drought.\n\nThe decline in the domestic scrap market reduced the already low interest in imports. Japanese scrap prices are still unacceptable to China. Last week, import prices were stable at $410/t.\n\nUSA scrap metal market for the week of April 17-24, 2023, fell by 4.2% compared to the previous week \u2013 $385-390/t.\n\nHeading into May trading, sentiment in the US scrap market has soured after last week\u2019s sharp drop in Turkish prices. Despite the fact that market participants do not have unequivocal predictions about the dynamics of prices of higher grades of scrap, everyone expects that the price of low-quality grades will fall during the auctions.\n\nTurkish plants continue to put pressure on the prices of American raw materials. As positive development of the situation is not expected in the near future, local traders are confident in the further decline of prices.\n\nThe mood for Taiwanese exports is not better. Local mills have also begun to put pressure on raw material prices, believing that current price levels are too high.\n\n\u201cThe steel market depends on the dynamics of the world economy development. Currently, there is an expectation that its condition will worsen in the second half of the year, in particular, due to the deepening of the banking crisis in the USA. These expectations have a negative impact on steel companies as well, encouraging them not to increase steel production and demand for scrap,\u201d notes GMK Center analyst Andriy Glushchenko.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in March 2023 decreased by 23.2% compared to the previous month \u2013 to 70.4 thousand tons. The export of scrap metal for March 2023 amounted to 15.5 thousand tons, which is 6.1% less m/m."

    "fullArticle": "During the month, Turkish steelmakers produced 2.1 million tons of steel\n\nIn February 2023, steel enterprises of Turkiye reduced steel production by 19.2% compared to January 2023 \u2013 to 2.104 million tons. This is evidenced by the data, published on the website of the World Steel Association.\n\nCompared to February 2022, Turkish steelmakers reduced steel production by 28.9% in February 2023.\n\nIn January-February 2023, domestic steelmakers produced 4.709 million tons of steel, which is 23.1% less than in the same period of 2022.\n\nFrom March 1, 2023, the Turkish oil pipeline corporation BOTA\u015e reduced wholesale prices on natural gas for large industrial enterprises by 20.95-26.12% compared to October 2022.\n\nThe reduction in prices will in some way ease the situation of Turkish steel producers, whose competitiveness has decreased because their energy costs are higher compared to their competitors in the European Union.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the Turkish energy market regulator announced a 16% reduction in electricity prices for industrial consumers.\n\nSuch actions were supposed to facilitate the work of the Turkish steel industry, but the deadly earthquakes in Turkiye, which occurred in February 2023, destabilized the work of the country\u2019s industry, destroyed logistics and led to the death of many people. As a result, part of the steel capacities in the country were suspended or reduced, which significantly affected the production results of Turkish steelmakers.\n\nAt the same time, in the near future, Turkiye plans to start rebuilding the destroyed infrastructure, loading the domestic steel industry with orders. Almost all produced rebar will be directed to the domestic market, and importers from the Middle East, who consumed about 4 million tons of steel products from Turkiye per year, will temporarily lose a supplier. Such a deficit of steel in the future may provoke an increase in prices in these regions.\n\nTurkiye ranks eighth in the world in terms of steel production. In 2022, Turkish enterprises reduced production of steel by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons."

    "fullArticle": "5 million tons of steel will be needed to rebuild the regions affected by the earthquake\n\nTurkiye\u2019s trade ministry and the country\u2019s steel producers have agreed to set up a price control mechanism to prevent speculation in a meeting to supply steel products for reconstruction projects in earthquake-hit regions. Eurometal informs about it with the reference to S&P Global.\n\nDuring 2023, the Housing Authority of Turkiye plans to build 350,000 houses in the affected southeastern part of the country. According to calculations, this will require 5 million tons of steel products, including 3 million tons of rebar, 750,000 tons of wire rod, and 1.25 million tons of sheet steel.\n\nRepresentatives of the steel industry noted that these volumes can be satisfied by the domestic market. At the same time, there was talk of increasing prices for raw materials and steel products after the earthquakes.\n\nWhen detailing costs at the production stage, steel producers paid attention to the share of raw materials and energy in the cost of production. Government officials and steelmakers have reached an agreement that there will be no increase in the prices of rebar, except for fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. In addition, a price control mechanism was agreed to prevent speculation in the market.\n\nImported billet and scrap prices have risen domestically in recent weeks due to demand for steel for reconstruction projects. The necessary volumes, producers note, can be obtained by contracting organizations focusing on the domestic market.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Turkiye stabilizes prices of construction materials, including steel products, for the reconstruction of areas affected by earthquakes, said Veysel Yayan, CEO of the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD). He noted that the country has enough production capacity to meet the expected increase in demand for steel. At the same time, most long-rolled steel producers have stopped accepting rebar orders from Turkish exchanges and traders."

    "fullArticle": "Gas prices for industry are also expected to rise by 15-20%\n\nTurkiye has been increasing electricity tariffs by 20% since October 2023, which will create additional pressure on the country\u2019s steel industry. Gas prices for industry are also expected to rise by 15-20% from October. This is reported by Kallanish.\n\nTurkish steel producers, which have difficulty selling rolled steel to export markets due to uncompetitive prices, will face additional pressure from rising energy tariffs. This, coupled with declining global steel demand and resilient scrap prices, is likely to exacerbate export problems for locally produced products.\n\nMost Turkish long steel producers have tried to keep rebar prices at $575-585/t over the past week, although some have resorted to lower levels of $560-565/t. Wire rod offers were $580-595/t.\n\nExport demand, even at these price levels, was weak. Among the importers of Turkish rebar were Israel and Yemen. Buyers from Costa Rica and Jamaica also showed interest in Turkish products, but no agreements were reached.\n\nCurrently, prices for long steel products in Turkiye are noticeably higher compared to competitors on the world market, and an increase in electricity tariffs will put local producers at a more disadvantageous position. In particular, North African producers offer corresponding products at $540-550/t, while traders from the Persian Gulf offer $535/t.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, at the end of January 2023, BOTA\u015e announced that from February 1, 2023, it will reduce wholesale prices for natural gas for large industrial enterprises by 13.3-17.2%. After that price adjustment took place in March and April \u2013 by 20.95-26.12% and 20.01%, respectively. Since May 2023, prices have remained unchanged.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the Turkish energy market regulator announced reduction in electricity prices for industrial consumers \u2013 by 16%. The department also reduced the maximum price for electricity on the free market from 4.8 thousand liras/MWh to 4.2 thousand liras/MWh. From April 2023 electricity for all Turkish consumers fell in price by another 15%.\n\nAlso, in September 2022 Turkiye raised prices for electricity and gas for industry by 50%. The regulatory agency linked the rise in electricity prices to rising energy prices, especially under the influence of the war in Ukraine."

    "fullArticle": "A quake rated 7.7 on the earthquake magnitude scale struck the Pazarcik district of Kahramanmaras province early on Monday, followed by a 7.6 magnitude quake centered on Kahramanmaras\u2019 Elbistan district. Several other provinces were affected, including Adana, Adiyaman, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Hatay, Kilis, Malatya, Iskenderun, Osmaniye and Sanliurfa.\n\n\u201cWe are in a state of force majeure. Turkey has already issued a fourth-level state alert and declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces [that will continue] for three months,\u201d an Iskenderun mill source said.\n\n\u201cPeople from other countries are calling to inquire about letters of credit and logistics. However, there isn\u2019t even an operating bank branch in the area. Everyone is trying extremely hard to save their own or their family\u2019s lives,\u201d he added.\n\nThe port of Iskenderun was damaged, and operations were halted as a result of the devastating earthquakes.\n\nAccording to the Maritime Authority of Turkey, operations at the port of Iskenderun have been halted because of the damage. Other ports in the country are operating normally, however, according to the administration.\n\nIskenderun is an important port in Turkey for steel imports and exports, as well as raw material deliveries, mostly of steel scrap.\n\nAccording to local sources, all possible resources at the Iskenderun port have been diverted to search and rescue activities.\n\nFurthermore, cities in the area have been declared off-limits to visitors, and civilian vehicles are not permitted to enter.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to conduct a thorough check at the steel plants. Right now, our top focus is saving people\u2019s lives,\u201d another Iskenderun mill source said.\n\nThe situation for vessels on the water transporting raw materials to the port of Iskenderun was unclear.\n\n\u201cIskenderun port ceased operations and diverted all its assets to search and rescue,\u201d a source in Iskenderun said. \u201cShips are anchored out at sea. They will either wait or be redirected to another port if the buyer permits this.\u201d\n\nPower supplies were also limited and could not be used for manufacturing. Fastmarkets was also informed that there were no staff available at the mills.\n\nAs a precaution, state pipeline operator Botas has discontinued the flow of natural gas to the provinces of Gaziantep, Hatay and Kahramanmaras, as well as other districts.\n\nAccording to sources in the area, natural gas flow resumed to the Iskenderun district on Tuesday.\n\nThe steel trade in other parts of Turkey was also very slow, because all of the country\u2019s resources were being devoted to search and rescue activities.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this horrific catastrophe has harmed the steel industry in other regions. The steel trade has slowed significantly,\u201d a mill source said. \u201cThe phones didn\u2019t ring today in the Istanbul region.\u201d\n\nThe state of emergency was declared by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He said that at least 3,549 people had been killed and 22,168 injured in 10 provinces.\n\nAccording to an announcement made on Monday by Turkey\u2019s Public Disclosure Platform (KAP), stock market trade affecting enterprises in the region, including Iskenderun Iron & Steel (Isdemir), has been forbidden until further notice.\n\nTurkish long steel prices faced significant uncertainty in the near term following the earthquakes, according to Alex Kershaw, senior analyst at Fastmarkets.\n\n\u201cThe earthquakes have affected several provinces in the country\u2019s southeast, which is home to around 30% of Turkey\u2019s steel-producing electric-arc furnace [EAF] capacity, equivalent to approximately 11.7 million tonnes [per year] of steel production, according to Fastmarkets\u2019 Capex service,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of these mills [roughly 80%] are long steel producers. Reports suggest that the mills in the region are mostly unaffected but, with the state energy provider halting gas shipments to the region temporarily, while at the same time the port of Iskenderun has been damaged, there will be a reduction in long steel availability for this month at least,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis will help tighten the long steel market and support export prices from the country, and consequently we have raised our forecast prices for the near term,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, scrap import demand among mills in the region is expected to be damped in the near term, helping to weigh on prices,\u201d he added, \u201calthough mills that are not in the affected region may seek increased scrap volumes, to meet the near-term void in steel output from mills in the earthquake-affected area.\u201d"

    "fullArticle": "This led to a sharp appreciation of the lira against other currencies, and domestic steel trading stopped\n\nOn August 24, 2023, the Central Bank (CB) of T\u00fcrkiye unexpectedly raised lending rates from 17.5% to 25%. This is reported Kallanish.\n\nTurkish market participants were shocked by this decision of the Central Bank, as it was previously noted that interest rates would rise at a moderate pace, despite high inflation. This led to a sharp appreciation of the Turkish lira against other currencies, and domestic steel trading stopped.\n\nSome producers of long products have lowered product prices after the recovery of the lira, while some mills have suspended trading in anticipation of the stabilization of the exchange rate. At the same time, domestic prices for rebar in dollars mostly exceeded $580/t ex-works.\n\nTraders, who had taken a wait-and-see approach in hopes of a modest rise in interest rates and stockpiled at the strong dollar, recorded big losses after the lira\u2019s sharp rise. Traders are now expected to buy more products to bring down the average inventory value.\n\nOn the export market, the official offers of Turkish mills for rebar were mainly $580-590/t compared to $570-580/t a week earlier.\n\nSteel sales will remain limited to small volumes and traditional markets this week as the difference between prices in Turkey and competitors in export markets has widened further, making Turkish offerings more unattractive.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, Turkish steelmakers have been suffering since March due to the lack of export demand and weak domestic sales. Export markets have been taken over by cheap Asian products, while Turkish-made steel cannot compete on the global stage due to the higher cost, which is justified by the higher cost of production. The domestic market is also inactive due to macroeconomic instability, the devaluation of the lira and uncertainty about the future development of the market. Recently, the Turkish authorities increased VAT on steel products by 20%, as well as an excise tax on fuel, which added even more uncertainty to the steel market in the country.\n\nAgainst this background steel producers of the country call for protectionist measures to prevent the import of dumping and low-quality products into the country, based on world practices, including those of the United States and the European Union.\n\nAs GMK Center reported, steel producers of T\u00fcrkiye according to the results of July 2023, steel production increased by 6.4% compared to July 2022 \u2013 up to 2.892 million tons. In January-July, Turkey produced 18.81 million tons of steel, which is 13.5% less y/y."

    "fullArticle": "China is breaking out of the general trend thanks to a recovery in steel demand\n\nGlobal scrap prices continued to decline last week due to lack of trading activity in the Turkish market and uncertainty in finished steel markets in many parts of the world.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap on the Turkish market, according to Kallanish, during March 27 \u2013 April 3, 2023, fell by $5/t, or by 1.1%, compared to the previous week \u2013 to $439/t. Thus, quotations of raw materials on the Turkish market have fallen for the second week in a row.\n\nScrap quotations continued to decline last week as Turkish steel mills refrained from purchases. Although local steelmakers\u2019 inventories are low, no contracting is taking place as most producers await a recovery in steel demand before resuming purchases of raw materials.\n\nDemand for rebar in Turkiye is low, with prices continuing to fall due to Ramadan, upcoming elections and uncertainty over the recovery of earthquake-hit cities.\n\nAccording to traders, soon steelmakers will have to return to the market, as the reserves of raw materials will gradually run out. Holding back purchases by steelmakers in the future could be reflected in a sharp jump in scrap prices, when everyone needs raw materials and supply is limited due to low collection rates.\n\nIn the short term, Turkiye\u2019s scrap market should recover, as electricity and gas prices for the country\u2019s heavy industry have been reduced by 15% and 20%, respectively, from 1 April 2023.\n\nIncreasing the margins of the mills by reducing the costs of non-energy resources will allow the purchase of raw materials, in particular, scrap at market prices, so a further decrease is not expected. Traders indicate that the current price is the lowest that can be offered amid high freight costs.\n\nThe recovery of the scrap market will be restrained by uncertainty in the finished steel market. Sales of Turkish rebars are at a low level, but the recent decline in energy costs has allowed local producers to lower product prices to win orders and regain competitiveness in the global market, although there has been no uptick in purchases so far.\n\nDespite the current unfavorable situation in the Turkish scrap market, most participants expect the recovery of domestic demand for rebar and scrap in Turkiye this week. The May purchases of raw materials to the local steel mills have mostly not been completed, and some plants have not even finished booking their April shipments.\n\nOn the USA market scrap metal quotations repeat Turkiye\u2019s trends. For the week of March 27-April 3, 2023, prices for HMS 1/2 scrap on the East Coast fell by $3/t, or by 0.7% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $412-416/t. The decline in prices has been observed for the second week in a row.\n\nSentiment on the US market weakened amid falling prices in Turkiye and lack of demand from Turkish steelmakers. Although most market participants did not expect a downward trend, recent contracts for American scrap from Turkish customers point to the inevitability of price declines.\n\nOverall export demand for US scrap is also low due to a slowdown in global trade, which is also putting pressure on prices. On the other hand, scrap supply remains tight and restrains the decline.\n\nStrong domestic demand is restraining the fall in prices in the local market, but the pace of production growth at local steel mills is gradually slowing down, so this trend is not long-term. Many local mills are expected to experience seasonal maintenance shutdowns during April, making the market more dependent on export demand.\n\nAccording to market participants, on the eve of April trading, prices will continue to decrease for depreciation scrap, but for crushed scrap and high-grade raw materials will increase. On the US East and West coasts, scrap quotations will fall due to weak export demand, while the Midwest will likely rise.\n\nChinese scrap market (Eastern China) for the week of March 24-31, 2023, recovered by $7/t compared to the previous week \u2013 to $449/t amid the revival of steel production.\n\nSteel enterprises of the country, which work on electric arc furnaces, last week were loaded by 82.3%, which is 5.3 percentage points less compared to the previous week. At the same time, the average daily scrap consumption during this period increased slightly \u2013 by 0.4%, to 323,000 tons.\n\nChina\u2019s scrap import market is quite calm. Negotiations on import agreements are not underway. According to steelmakers, the highest viable price for imported scrap in China is currently around $400/t, but imported raw materials are offered at $450-470/t. In general, there is currently no interest in foreign raw materials, as price levels for imported scrap significantly exceed domestic supply.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, the volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in January-February 2023 decreased by 70.8% compared to the same period in 2022 \u2013 to 152.2 thousand tons. The export of raw materials during this period amounted to 24.8 thousand tons, which is 3.5 times more y/y, and import \u2013 0.04 thousand tons (-60% y/y)."

    "fullArticle": "On the German ferrous scrap market, the year 2023 ended with an unexpectedly strong price increase. Once again, as is often the case, the momentum was provided by the export business with Turkey. From the beginning of the month, Turkish steel mills started to ramp up their purchases. The resulting leap in export prices then also caused scrap prices in Germany to rise by a double-digit euro figure.\n\nNevertheless, traders say scrap demand from local steel mills remains subdued overall. In response to the price rally, some steelworks had attempted to top up their scrap inventories a bit before the Christmas holidays. In many instances, though, the trading volumes were small and transactions were only being done to maintain business relationships, market participants explained.\n\nTraders say they were \"caught completely off-guard\" by the considerable price upswing at the end of the year. When surveyed in November, they had been expecting prices to remain steady or even decline slightly. But Turkish steel producers\u2019 growing appetite for imports combined with limited scrap availability led to a rapid surge in export prices in early December.\n\nRead the full monthly market report and access the price table and graphing tools here:"

    "fullArticle": "Turkish deepsea import scrap prices are expected to remain relatively firm over the first quarter of 2023, supported by tight supply, posing a continued challenge to Turkish steel mill margins, sources said.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nPlatts assessed Turkish bulk imports of premium heavy melting scrap 1/2 (80:20) at $386.75/mt CFR Dec. 23, unchanged day on day.\n\nThe assessment averaged $444.69/mt CFR over the year to Dec. 23, down slightly from $463.43/mt CFR over 2021, despite the assessment also reaching an all-time high of $665/mt CFR March 16, as a result of raw material supply concerns fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February.\n\nThe LME scrap forward curve over January-March 2023 is in a soft backwardation, with January contracts assessed by Platts at $381.50/mt Dec. 23, while March contracts were at $379.50/mt. This suggests future traders expect some softening in physical prices in the near term, but prices are expected to remain largely firm.\n\nScrap availability has remained tight amid lower industrial activity and weak consumer confidence in the key ferrous scrap exporting regions to Turkey, such as the UK, continental Europe, the Baltics and the US. The usual seasonal downturn in scrap collection rates during the winter has also hit supply.\n\nTurkish mills struggled to remain competitive in the export steel markets into the second half of 2022, relying mostly on domestic steel demand, amid rising production costs caused by sharp hikes in electricity and gas prices, as well as relatively firm scrap prices.\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the daily outright spread between Turkish export rebar and import scrap at $272.25/mt Dec. 23, reaching at its lowest level since early September. Mills had previously attempted to target an outright spread of around $300/mt to factor in higher scrap and production costs but have had to accept a lower spread to catch sales in the export rebar market.\n\nPlatts assessed Turkish export rebar at $659/mt FOB Turkey Dec. 23, unchanged day on day.\n\nIn September, Turkish electricity prices rose 50%, and gas prices for industrial use also rose 50.8%, while in October, gas prices rose around 37.2% for industrial use. So far, market sources aren't expecting a further increase in gas and electricity prices in January 2023.\n\n\"Come January, the new minimum wage will start to weigh on mills' costs, and margins are super squeezed already,\" one Turkish scrap agent said, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's announcement Dec. 22 of a 55% increase in the Turkish minimum wage to Lira 8,500 a month ($455), effective January 2023, in an attempt to ease the impact of rampant inflation on workers, ahead of presidential elections due to take place June 18.\n\n\"It is going to be challenging in 2023, but maybe before the elections, the government will give some [support] package to the industry,\" a Turkish trader said. \"I don't expect the demand to be much lower than this year, and it will be difficult for Turkish mills stop production. The capacity utilization is already 50%-55%, which is supported by the domestic market, but for more capacity usage it needs to be better in the export market.\"\n\nTurkish market participants will also be looking closely at how competing scrap demand develops from India, the world's second-largest crude steel producing nation after China, with ambitions to reach an annual crude steel production of 300 million mt by 2030.\n\nIndia became a key competitor to Turkey for scrap in the second half of 2022, as high coal prices and high container freights (India is a large importer of containerized scrap) made bulk scrap cargoes more attractive pricewise.\n\nAccording to S&P Global's Commodities at Sea platform, India imported about 951,300 mt of ferrous scrap in 26 bulk cargoes since September 2022, with four further cargoes totaling 166,000 mt in transit as of Dec. 23.\n\nLonger-term factors\n\nMarket participants will also be closely watching in January 2023 for the European Parliament's plenary vote on the European Commission's proposed legislation on waste shipment exports.\n\nUnder the proposal, EU ferrous scrap exports to non-OECD countries will only be allowed if they can be managed sustainably. The time frame for implementation is unclear, but market sources have previously voiced expectations of 2026.\n\nThe EU is the world's largest exporter of ferrous scrap, with 2021 total export of ferrous metals scrap reaching 19.5 million mt, according to Eurostat data.\n\nTurkey, an OECD member, could theoretically benefit in terms of reduced competition for material, should the legislation be approved in its current guise. India, a non-OECD member, but a growing scrap importer, could be affected.\n\nIncreased demand for ferrous scrap globally, and thus greater competition for import-reliant Turkey, is likely to continue in 2023, as steel mills globally look to introduce a greater volume of ferrous scrap into their raw materials mix as a part of a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from production."

    "fullArticle": "Falling steel prices make it impossible to buy scrap at current prices\n\nWorld scrap prices continued to decline last week amid lack of demand from steel enterprises. Falling prices for steel forces steelmakers to refuse purchases of raw materials in order not to suffer losses.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap in Turkiye for the week of April 24 \u2013 May 1, 2023, fell by 2.9% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $399-403/t. The country\u2019s steel enterprises continue to refrain from concluding agreements on the purchase of scrap metal.\n\nMarket sentiment worsens every day as steelmakers continue to reduce capacity utilization amid a lack of steel sales, which in turn reduces already sluggish demand for scrap metal. Sales of Turkish steel are suffering due to uncompetitive prices in the export market. In addition, the lira\u2019s depreciation against the dollar also hit already low sales of finished steel.\n\nIn March 2023, exports of rebars from Turkiye fell to a historic low of 202.4 thousand tons. A similar scenario is expected in April. The combination of these factors has reduced scrap prices for the third week in a row. During this time, prices lost about $40/t and crossed the threshold of $400/t, which was last reached at the end of 2022.\n\nTurkish buyers do not see the prospect of replenishing raw material stocks, as they cannot sell the products they already have. Although some contracts are concluded, each time their value becomes less and less. Some traders agree to the pressure of steelmakers and sell raw materials at the price dictated by the consumer.\n\nMarket participants predict that scrap prices in Turkiye will soon drop to $360/t, as consumer pressure and the impact of economic factors will increase ahead of the presidential election.\n\nPrices for Chinese scrap market last week continued its decline. Quotations of raw materials on the domestic market fell by 6.5% \u2013 to $404.1/t. Demand for scrap is weakening due to negative expectations on the steel market, which is causing purchases to be suspended.\n\nDuring April 21-28, 2023, Chinese EAF plants used 62.2% of production capacity, which is 4.2 percentage points less than the previous week.\n\nThe average daily volume of scrap supplies to all steel enterprises amounted to 264,000 tons, which is 8% less compared to the week of April 14-21. The average daily consumption of raw materials fell by 8.6% \u2013 to 288,000 tons.\n\nThe price of scrap on the USA market for the week of April 24 \u2013 May 1, 2023, decreased by 3.1% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $374-378/t.\n\nThe negative state of the Turkish market continues to affect US scrap prices. With no demand from Turkish steelmakers and steel prices continuing to fall, the market does not expect commodity prices to rise in the short term.\n\nCurrently, the global scrap market depends on steel prices in China. Turkish steelmakers cannot sell finished products in export markets because Asian and Russian sellers offer lower price levels that are out of reach for Turkiye. Scrap suppliers from the US depend on Turkish and Taiwanese consumers who do not want to buy raw materials without understanding the prospects for steel sales, so they expect a significantly greater drop in scrap prices.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in March 2023 decreased by 23.2% compared to the previous month \u2013 to 70.4 thousand tons. The export of scrap metal for March 2023 amounted to 15.5 thousand tons, which is 6.1% less m/m."

    "fullArticle": "Scrap quotations on the Turkish market for the week of March 6-13, 2023, increased by $8/t, and since the beginning of the year \u2013 by $64/t\n\nWorld prices for scrap continue to rise in most regions of the world amid high activity in the market of Turkiye \u2013 one of the largest importers of scrap metal. Positive dynamics are also supported by the restoration of demand for steel, and, as a result, the increase in steel production.\n\nPrices for HMS 1/2 scrap on the Turkish market, according to the Kallanish data, during March 6-13, 2023, increased by $8/t, or by 1.5%, compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $460-465/t, and since the beginning of the year \u2013 by $64/t, or 16%. The current upward trend has been observed for the past three weeks.\n\nQuotations of scrap in Turkiye began a sharp rise some time after the earthquakes, when the country\u2019s government announced a plan to restore the affected regions in the next 3-4 months. Steel plants, in anticipation of a sharp increase in demand for rebar, began to purchase raw materials in order to fill warehouse stocks and be ready for a possible increase in production.\n\nLocal steel mills have indicated that they are ready to meet domestic demand for steel, which will be used to rebuild infrastructure, while export sales will almost completely cease.\n\nUntil steelmakers see stable and strong demand for steel, they have to sacrifice margins as scrap prices have increased and there is not enough demand for rebar at prices to match scrap quotations. Suppliers of scrap, in turn, refuse to reduce prices for raw materials.\n\nWith abundant supply of raw materials from all regions and low demand from Turkish mills, scrap prices are expected to peak. Quotations stabilize at the achieved level. Most mills are waiting for clarity in the market before accelerating scrap purchases.\n\nOn the European market, scrap prices also rose due to the positive situation in Turkiye and high demand from steelmakers. In particular, in Italy scrap prices as of March 10, 2023, have increased by \u20ac30/t compared to March 3 \u2013 up to \u20ac400-440/t. In general, a similar trend is observed in France, Spain and the entire Eastern European region.\n\nThe formation of raw material quotations was also influenced by the increase in tariffs for rail and intermodal freight transportation from Northern and Eastern Europe, and the rise in steel prices.\n\nIn USA scrap quotations are growing significantly amid March trading, which started a week ago. This is the fourth consecutive increase in auction prices in the US after a long downward trend last year. For the week of March 3-10, 2023, scrap prices on the East Coast of the United States increased by $5/t \u2013 up to $436-441/t.\n\nAs it was expected, scrap prices were supported by rising export supplies, improving order books and rising US steel prices. April is also expected to give a strong boost to scrap prices in the States.\n\nChinese scrap market has stabilized as a large supply has freed the market from supply problems. As of March 10, 2023, scrap quotations in eastern China were 3.15 thousand yuan/t ($453/t), up 5 yuan compared to the previous week.\n\nAfter a rise in steel prices last week, the price of scrap has stabilized and scrap collectors have stepped up supply after fully resuming operations after the holidays. Although scrap consumption in China has increased due to the resumption of production at EAF plants and increased use of such raw materials in blast furnaces, supply and demand are currently poorly balanced.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, world scrap consumption in the first half of 2022 decreased by 8.4% compared to the same period in 2021 \u2013 to 248.79 million tons. The negative trend in demand for scrap was supported by the decline in global steel production.\n\nThe world consumption of scrap metal in steel production in 2021 increased to 620 million tons. Over the year, the share of scrap in steel producing increased to 32%, while in 2019 it was 30%, and in 2020, at the height of the pandemic \u2013 29%."

Turkish steelmakers remain aloof from the purchase of raw materials amid lack of demand for steel. A similar situation is observed in China, as prices for finished products continue to fall, and the US market is under pressure from low demand from export buyers \u2013 Turkiye and Taiwan.\n\nPrices for HMS \u00bd scrap metal in Turkiye for the week of April 10-17, 2023, fell by 2% compared to the previous week \u2013 to $429-431/t. Demand for scrap from Turkish steelmakers remains weak despite the end of the holidays and has been stagnant since mid-March. At the same time, some plants began to resume raw material purchases.\n\nContracts are concluded with sellers who are unable to contain the fall in prices and offer raw materials at discounts, which gradually collapses the market. Last week there were rumors about several concluded agreements for the supply of European and American raw materials.\n\nAccording to Turkish steelmakers, in the future scrap prices will drop to $400/t, or even $380/t, as the current situation on the global steel market does not favor the growth of raw material prices. The situation can change only if the demand for finished products is restored.\n\nTurkish rebar prices are falling because it is uncompetitive in export markets and scrap quotes are at a high level, making it impossible to offer rebar at competitive prices. This puts Turkiye\u2019s steelmakers in a dead end despite the recent discount on energy resources.\n\nCurrently, Turkiye\u2019s scrap market is maximally dependent on rebar sales, so as long as there is no demand, the price of scrap metal will decrease. There will be little activity on the market, as there are very few concluded contracts for May. The price will be able to recover to higher levels, if the country\u2019s authorities still start works on the restoration of infrastructure, which were planned for March-May, but have not started.\n\nPrices for Chinese scrap market last week also fell by 1.6% \u2013 to $438/t. Steel mills continue to cut capacity amid weak demand and lower steel prices, which in turn affects scrap consumption.\n\nThe loading of China\u2019s electric arc steel plants last week fell by 9 pp by the previous week \u2013 to 78.3%. Scrap supplies to metallurgical enterprises fell by 9.9% to 309,000 tons.\n\nElectric arc furnace (EAF) steel companies continued to announce production cuts in response to margin losses due to falling steel prices. Only in the Sichuan province in the southwest of the country, the consumption of scrap at the EAF has decreased by more than 60%.\n\nImport prices for scrap in China for the week of April 7-14 also decreased \u2013 by 1.2%, to $410/t. Foreign raw materials are not of interest to local steelmakers, as the demand for local scrap is also weak. However, the interest of Chinese buyers in Japanese scrap began to grow. Raw materials at $410/t with short delivery times can activate Chinese importers.\n\nUSA scrap metal market for the week of April 10-17, 2023, fell to $405-407/t compared to $414-418/t a week earlier. Domestic scrap prices face further pressure from weak global sentiment, weak export demand and rising supply for May tenders.\n\nThe receipt of depreciation scrap increased due to seasonal factors. On the other hand, these types of scrap, which were primarily sent for export, are currently in weak demand. This, combined with a weakening Chinese market and pressure on US steel prices, is adding pressure to scrap prices.\n\nThe Taiwanese market is not buying American scrap because local steelmakers are interested in cheaper Japanese raw materials, and Turkish buyers have suspended purchases because steel sales are at a low level. With weak sentiment, prevailing uncertainty ahead of Turkiye\u2019s upcoming elections and weak steel sales, local mills are expected to be interested in further lowering scrap prices.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, volumes of scrap metal collection in Ukraine in March 2023 decreased by 23.2% compared to the previous month \u2013 to 70.4 thousand tons. The export of scrap metal for March 2023 amounted to 15.5 thousand tons, which is 6.1% less than m/m."

    "fullArticle": "Shane Mellor, managing director of Mellor Metals, warned that the home and export markets for recycled metal have seen prices dip recently, as a result of Turkish finished product prices falling.\n\nTurkey is one of the largest importers of UK recycled metal, but the price of finished product there has been falling in recent months which means the price they are willing to pay for scrap also falls.\n\nThis echoes what many other ferrous recyclers have been saying in recent weeks, as the aftermath of the earthquake in the south of the country and uncertainty from the Turkish election also take hold.\n\nMarkets\n\nMr Mellor said the fall in Turkish finished product prices has \u201creverberated around the recycled metal markets as consumers seek lower-priced raw feed\u201d.\n\nHe also stated that the deep-sea bulk market \u201cseems to have been the forerunner, dropping by around 20% in the last few days, with UK consumers and container destinations aligning their prices to more favourable terms (down around 12%)\u201d.\n\nHe tipped the market to remain \u201cbearish\u201d in the short to medium term, although the shortage of material \u201cwill be pivotal to a correction at some point\u201d.\n\nDomestic\n\nMr Mellor added that UK steel mills are continuing to secure all their domestic recycled raw material needs, albeit at lower levels. However, the export market remains the major outlet for recycled raw materials in the UK, the largest exporter by country within the European zone.\n\nAlong with material shortages, UK merchants are continuing to endure a lack of available staff as well as high energy and inflationary costs.\n\nThe continuing uncertainty surrounding the situation in Ukraine, elevated energy/labour costs and fears over the global economy and financial markets are all having an impact on sentiment.\n\nTurkey\n\nThe falling Turkish demand was also noted by Mogens Bach Christensen of Danish firm H.J.Hansen Genvindingsindustri A/S.\n\nIn his report, he said the impact of inflation and interest rates are being felt, and this is made worse by the Turkish situation.\n\n\u201cThe logic is simple: if heating costs rise as strongly as was the case in 2022, then replacing the family car will be postponed and its life will therefore be extended; and when the business environment is uncertain, industrial investments are shelved accordingly.\n\n\u201c[Turkish] prices have been on a downtrend, driven primarily by falling demand for finished steel. The Indian market for recycled steel has been relatively stable over the last year, generally being considerably less volatile than is the case for Turkey; recently, however, Indian prices have also followed a downward trend.\u201d\n\nUS recycled steel dealers enjoyed a surprisingly robust first quarter George Adams, SA Recycling (USA)\n\nGlobal\n\nElsewhere, a report from George Adams of SA Recycling (USA) and fellow BIR board member, said that US recycled steel dealers and steel mills \u201cenjoyed a surprisingly robust first quarter to 2023\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlthough this year\u2019s first quarter was slow to develop, it started to become clear by February that orders for new steel were exceeding anticipated demand. That set off a chain reaction of steadily rising new steel prices and, in a market of low recycled steel supplies, of upward pressure on recycled steel prices.\u201d"

S&P Global reports about it.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s regulatory documentation, the target sales volume is 173 thousand tons of billet, 141 thousand tons of rebar, 131 thousand tons of wire rod. It is also expected that sales of steel profiles in the second quarter of 2023 will amount to 119 thousand tons.\n\n30% of each position is reserved for the shareholders of the company due to pre-emptive rights.\n\nMeanwhile, billet prices on the Black Sea market fell again amid a decline in supply and a lack of interest in buying from Turkiye. During the week, the situation for importers of these products into the country worsened.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, the electricity costs of Turkish steel mills will continue to fall in the coming months after a sharp increase in 2022, which negatively affected the export competitiveness of local producers. This was stated by the head of the Turkish Union of Steel Exporters (CIB) Adnan Aslan. According to him, the cost of gas for local steel producers will still be higher than in the EU, but prices may balance with the European level as early as June this year.\n\nSteel enterprises of Turkiye in February 2023 reduced steel production by 19.2% compared to January 2023 \u2013 to 2.104 million tons. Compared to February 2022, in February 2023, production decreased by 28.9%. In January-February 2023, local steelmakers produced 4.709 million tons of steel, which is 23.1% less compared to the same period in 2022."

    "fullArticle": "In this article, Fastmarkets highlights the major changes the global steel market has faced as a result of the war.\n\nUkraine\n\nThe loss of control over two large mills based in Mariupol (Azovstal and Illych Steel, which belonged to major Ukrainian steelmaker Metinvest) as well as logistical and procurement problems resulted in a massive drop in Ukraine\u2019s steel output.\n\nAccording to the World Steel Association (Worldsteel), the country produced 4.82 million tonnes of crude steel in January-July 2022, down by 62.14% from 12.73 million tonnes produced over the same period last year.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainian steelmakers have faced port blockades and seizures by Russian forces.\n\nAccording to a map published by the UK ministry of defense on August 22, all major ports on the Sea of Azov, as well as the port of Kherson, which has a river connection with the Black Sea, are controlled by Russia. Meanwhile, the major Black Sea ports remain blocked for all vessels except those shipping grains and associated products and fertilizers, including ammonia, in accordance with a recent deal made with the Russian government.\n\nThere have been discussions in political circles that steel products may be included in the grain deal, too, in exchange for the easing of western sanctions against Russian steel, which could help enliven steel export shipments. Nothing official has been announced yet, however.\n\nAs a result of the port blockages, Ukrainian steelmakers have had to use alternative options for transporting their products, but those are not sufficient to maintain decent export activity. Some alternative routes include the delivery of goods to Europe by truck and rail, as well as shipments from Black Sea ports in Romania and Bulgaria and from Baltic Sea ports in Poland.\n\nBefore the war, Ukrainian business exported 80% of ferrous metals and 70% of iron ore through the ports of Odessa and Mykolaiv\n\n\u201cBefore the war, Ukrainian business exported 80% of ferrous metals and 70% of iron ore through the ports of Odessa and Mykolaiv,\u201d Volodymyr Tkachenko, the head of Kiev branch of ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, was quoted as saying in media reports.\n\n\u201cThe available railway crossings are able to let through not more than 1,900 cars per day, while the country\u2019s export capacities need a minimum 3,400 cars per day,\u201d Olexandr Kalenkov, the president of national steelmakers\u2019 union Ukrmetallurgprom, said in the same publication.\n\nRussia\n\nSteel output in Russia also decreased during the reviewed period.\n\nOver the first seven months of the current year, Russia produced 41.43 million tonnes of steel, down by 6.96% in a year-on-year comparison, according to Worldsteel.\n\nIn August, though, an official from Russia said that \u201cthere is also a significant decline in domestic consumption. As a result, the steel industry\u2019s capacity utilization has dropped to 80% from an average of 93%.\u201d He added that the capacity utilization rates for Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works and for Severstal stood at 62% at 72% respectively.\n\nThe drop was mainly driven by the effects of western sanctions imposed against the country for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union only seven packages of sanctions against Russia, including general sanctions that hit banking, insurance and shipping services as well as those which hit the steel industry and some of its main participants directly.\n\nFor example, sanctions against Severstal\u2019s owner Alexey Mordashov \u2014 combined with a ban on finished steel shipments from Russia to the EU \u2014 pushed Severstal, which was Russia\u2019s main flat steel supplier to Europe, out of this market and forced the steelmaker to concentrate on the domestic market or look for support in alternative outlets. Before the war, the company was mainly concentrated on lucrative finished steel sales in Europe, but recently it had been heard offering slab in Turkey and Asia at comparatively low prices.\n\nThe western sanctions significantly reduced the number of buyers willing and able to touch products made in Russia.\n\nTurkey, Mexico, China and Taiwan became the main outlets for Russian exports. And while the number of potential buyers decreased, prices also started to fall, creating significant pressure on the global market.\n\nRussia used to export 40% of its steel production.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that part of the export market is closed for us,\u201d Vladimir Lisin, the main shareholder in the country\u2019s Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Works (NLMK), said.\n\nNeither NLMK, nor its shareholders, have yet been hit by direct sanctions.\n\n\u201cThere is also a decrease in activity in the Russian market, [and] a surplus of 40% has been created [which traditionally used to be exported], out of which [only] 10-15% can still find the outlet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere does the rest go? The domestic market has never consumed so much.\u201d\n\nIn the first half of 2022, NLMK reported a 1-million-tonne fall in sales from the level predicted. According to the company\u2019s forecasts, the entire Russian metallurgy industry will lose 30-50% of its budgeted sales because of the country\u2019s war on Ukraine.\n\nMounting pressure on prices\n\nAs the initial shock from the war \u2014 and an accompanying surge in steel product prices \u2014 has waned, Russian prices started to fall as suppliers tried to attract customers despite the sanctions.\n\nThis stimulated competition globally, particularly in semi-finished steel segment (billet and slab account for the largest portion of Russian steel exports), which in its turn had a negative effect on the finished steel market.\n\nFor example, as of August 24, Fastmarkets\u2019 steel billet index export, fob Black Sea, CIS averaged $521.33 per tonne in the month to date, down by 22.44% from an average of $672.20 per tonne in February.\n\n\u201cSanctions against Russian products created a new market for them, which depreciated Turkish long steel prices,\u201d one Turkish source said.\n\nFastmarkets\u2019 price assessment for steel reinforcing bar (rebar), export, fob main port Turkey averaged $641.60 per tonne in the month to date, down by 14.02% from an average of $746.25 per tonne in February.\n\nA United Arab Emirates-based producing source said that cheap Russian billet pressured Iranian billet prices, which in its turn prompted domestic buyers to reduce asking prices for rebar.Fastmarkets\u2019 weekly price assessment for steel billet, export, fob ports Iran averaged $448.88 per tonne to date in August, down by 23.38% from $585.88 per tonne in February.\n\n\u201cRussia is offering very low prices, some say even dumping to markets where they were not sanctioned yet, like in the Far East, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa,\u201d one trader from Turkey said.\n\nBy volume, the most-exported final steel product from Russia has been hot-rolled coil.Fastmarkets\u2019 price assessment for steel HRC, export, fob Black Sea, CIS averaged $540 per tonne fob in the month to date, a drop of 39.66% compared with the February average of $895 per tonne.\n\nThe price assessment for steel HRC, import, cfr main port Turkey \u2014 the key typical destination for flat steel exports from Russia \u2014 averaged $591.67 per tonne in the month to date August, falling by 35.47% compared with $916.88 per tonne in February.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, Russian war against Ukraine caused a wave of a panic-buying during February-March, with prices for flat and long steel surging dramatically, reaching the new historic peaks and breaking the records set in summer 2021.\n\nFor example, Fastmarkets\u2019 calculation of its daily steel hot-rolled coil index, domestic, exw Northern Europe averaged \u20ac1,278.50 per tonne in March 2022, up by \u20ac326.49 per tonne from \u20ac952.01 per tonne in February and up by \u20ac489.60 per tonne from \u20ac788.90 per tonne in March 2021.\n\nMarket sentiment, however, has soured recently, mainly due to slowing end-user demand and overstocking that resulted from the earlier panic-buying.\n\nNotably, automotive output in Europe has declined due to acute component shortages that are not expected to be resolved until the end of 2022, sources said.\n\nAs a result, Fastmarkets\u2019 most recent calculation of its daily steel hot-rolled coil index, domestic, exw Northern Europe was at \u20ac720 per tonne on August 24, down by \u20ac247.14 per tonne from \u20ac967.14 per tonne on February 24.\n\nTrade flow changes\n\nThe disruption of trade flows was another major effect of the war on the global steel market.\n\nIn particular, the disappearance of Ukraine from the export market has opened opportunities for European and Asian suppliers.\n\nIn 2021, Italy imported 2.39 million tonnes of slab; Ukraine was its top supplier, accounting for 73.6% of that total, followed by Russia.\n\nOnce Ukraine stopped exporting slab to the country, buyers turned to suppliers from Asia \u2014 namely, India, China and Indonesia \u2014 to fill the gap.\n\nA similar situation has been noted in the plate market.\n\n\u201cOur regular buyers of plate in Europe, and in the Middle East and North Africa region, I suggest were impacted the most because we had a large market share,\u201d one supplier from Ukraine said, adding that these volumes have since been replaced with material from Asian and European suppliers.\n\nFastmarkets discontinued its price assessment for steel heavy plate, 8-50mm, export, fob Black Sea, CIS (MB-STE-0013), due to a substantial reduction in market activity.\n\nThe pig iron market in the United States was impacted a lot as well, because Ukraine and Russia covered around two-thirds of its import pig iron supply\n\n\u201cThe pig iron market in the United States was impacted a lot as well, because Ukraine and Russia covered around two-thirds of its import pig iron supply,\u201d the Ukrainian supplier said. \u201cBuyers there refused Russian pig iron completely, while we [Ukrainian suppliers] still can ship rather limited tonnages.\u201d\n\nPig iron buyers in the US have been forced to cut their pig iron consumption and increase their hot-briquetted iron (HBI) consumption. At the same time, US pig iron bookings from Brazil intensified in March.\n\n\u201cEvery single tonne of pig iron which could be produced in Brazil was produced, even those producers who normally focused on billet supply have been selling pig iron,\u201d one supplier of pig iron from Brazil said.\n\nAnd while the western world was looking for substitutes for Ukrainian and Russian volumes, Russian suppliers found support in Asian customers.\n\nLow prices and comparatively few problems with handling payments at banks turned Taiwan into a regular importer of semi-finished steel and HRC from Russia\u2019s Far East in April and May.\n\nShipments of semi-finished steel products to Taiwan from Russia jumped to 162,699 tonnes in May, according to Taiwanese customs figures, up by 57.4% year on year from 103,363 tonnes in May 2021. Russian semi-finished steel products accounted for 59.3% of all arrivals in May, up from 35.3% a year earlier.\n\nRussian exports to Taiwan have mostly been concluded by traders based in either China or the UAE and have taken place despite Taiwan\u2019s strong ties with the United States, according to sources.\n\nChina \u2014 which remains a very close ally with Russia despite the war \u2014 also has imported significant volumes of Russian semi-finished steel.\n\nChina imported 239,496 tonnes of steel slab in June, up 917% year on year. Some 122,423 tonnes of that total were purchases from Russia, according to Chinese customs statistics.\n\nOn the other hand, the war has led to a reduction in trade between Russia and another US ally, the Philippines. The main difference between the situation with Taiwan and that with the Philippines is that most Filipino banks still refuse to handle Russian cargo, making payment very difficult, according to market sources.\n\nThe Philippines imported zero tonnes of semi-finished steel from Russia in May, down from 23,930 tonnes in May 2021, according to customs stats. April semi-finished steel import volumes were 68,469 tonnes, down from 134,962 tonnes in April 2021.\n\nGrowing production costs in EuropeThe price uptrend in the European energy market that started in autumn 2021 has continued into 2022, with the situation getting even worse after February 24.\n\nFor example, in July 2021 average electricity prices in Italy were around \u20ac400 per MWh, up from about \u20ac271 per MWh in June 2022 and sharply up from \u20ac103 per MWh in July 2021, according to local energy service company Gestore dei Mercati Energetici (GME). During the week ended August 21, average electricity prices in Italy surpassed \u20ac500 per MWh.\n\nOn August 5, the European Commission approved a plan encouraging EU member countries to voluntarily reduce gas consumption by at least 15% between August 2022 and March 2023.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that countries will self-impose energy restrictions, if this did happen, energy prices would keep going through the roof. This in turn would force steel mills to increase prices, Fastmarkets has heard.\n\nBut European steel market fundamentals have been too weak recently to support a price rise, sources said.\n\nNotably, overstocking \u2014 coupled with contracting end-user demand \u2014 has been pushing flat steel prices in Europe down in recent months. As a result, European mills might be faced with the need to cut output further or even stop operations completely.\n\n\u201cIn theory, the gas rationing suggested by the European Commission [may] result in even more capacity being put offline,\u201d a trading source told Fastmarkets.\n\nStarting in June 2021, an increasing number of European flat steelmakers have been reducing output in order to balance demand and supply and spare flat steel prices from a sharp downtrend.\n\nStill, despite those efforts, the downtrend in Europe\u2019s hot-rolled coil market resumed in August, with prices continuing to sink.\n\nEffects on Middle East markets\n\nThe Egyptian steel market has been affected by the war between Russia and Ukraine in several aspects, according to sources.\n\nThe war resulted in \u201clower availability of billet even with low prices, combined with scarcity of foreign currency to pay for procured material,\u201d according to an Egyptian trader.\n\nEgypt has been suffering from a shortage of foreign currency recently, Fastmarkets understands.\n\n\u201cSanctions [on Russian steel] added difficulties on payments, and freight rates skyrocketed backed by fuel high prices,\u201d the trader said.\n\nFurthermore, the war resulted in \u201clower export tonnages from Egypt to the European Union, due to lower demand backed by higher energy costs. The war affected the energy costs, and this affected the local production, especially lower raw materials stocks. As a result, local production in Egypt is hand to mouth only now \u2014 prices not reflecting the actual costs,\u201d the trader said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s steel sector has also been directly affected because of low-priced imports from Russia, Turkish sources told Fastmarkets.\n\n\u201cThe crisis has been affecting Turkey deeper every day. Turkey\u2019s crude steel output decreased by 13% in June and 20% in July. Turkish exports decreased by 6.5% in the first six months of 2022, and decreased by about 8.5% by the end of August,\u201d Ugur Dalbeler, chief executive officer of Turkish steelmaker \u00c7olakoglu and vice president of the Turkish Steel Exporters Union (\u00c7IB), told Fastmarkets.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming period seems to be even worse. Many companies stopped importing raw materials and intermediate products from Russia because these companies have relations with the EU and the US. They have to buy from other sources at a higher cost. On the other hand, Russian producers cannot export their products to many countries because of sanctions, so they export to Turkey at prices with about 50% discount. This results in big losses for Turkish producers and the outlook for the fourth quarter seems much worse,\u201d Dalbeler said.\n\n\u201cAnother danger is that Turkish products may be subject to investigations on circumventing sanctions, and new sanctions may be imposed on Turkish steel. The only way to avoid this is to impose sanctions on Russian steel like the sanctions imposed by the EU and the US,\u201d Dalbeler added.\n\nNotably, a Turkish trader claimed that the European Commission imposed anti-dumping duties on Turkish hot-dipped galvanized coil because the substrate used for some HDG produced in Turkey is of Russian origin.\n\nElina Virchenko in Dubai contributed to this report."

    "fullArticle": "Producers of long rolled steel have stopped accepting orders for rebar from traders\n\nTurkiye stabilizes the prices of construction materials, including steel products, for the reconstruction of areas affected by earthquakes. S&P Global was told about it by Veysel Yayan, CEO of the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD).\n\nVeysel Yayan confirmed the statement of the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkiye that they are committed to fixing the prices of building materials for the reconstruction of houses in earthquake zones. Steel prices will also be fixed unless there is a noticeable increase in cost due to reasons beyond the producers\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cThis will be the contribution of the Turkish steel sector to the post-earthquake housing projects that will be initiated by the government, although steel mills have registered serious losses in the second half of 2022 due to low demand and high energy costs,\u201d Veysel Yayan noted.\n\nThe demand of the Turkish government to domestic producers for the need to supply 4 million tons of rebar within four months for restoration work in 11 cities of southeastern Turkiye led to an increase in demand and prices for scrap metal. Accordingly, the price of rebar also increased \u2013 according to S&P Global sources, at the end of February it was $650-670/t. Turkish steel mills only reflected the latest increase in scrap prices, Veysel Yayan explained.\n\nAs the CEO of TCUD noted, Turkiye has enough production capacity to meet the expected increase in demand for steel in the coming months when the reconstruction of the affected areas begins. Producers intend to prioritize domestic demand over exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of long-rolled producers have stopped accepting orders for rebar from Turkish exchanges and traders.\n\nOne of the major producer noted in a statement to customers that orders for rebar are accepted from contractors only on a project basis. Some other companies have also adopted this approach to be able to secure significant tonnages for rebuilding, which could lead to higher prices for these products.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, world scrap prices are growing amid of improving market sentiment. Demand for it continues to increase after the Turkish government\u2019s announcements regarding the reconstruction of cities after the earthquake. Prices for HMS 1/2 scrap on the Turkish market during February 20-27, 2023, increased by $32/t, or by 7.5%, compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $450-457/t."

    "fullArticle": "The steel industry of the country has already been shaken by the dual shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, resulting in increased raw material prices in the international market and supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, recent power and energy price hikes triggered by the country's dollar crisis have exacerbated the situation.\n\nAnother factor has recently been added to the already dire circumstances faced by entrepreneurs in the sector.\n\nThe international market is facing a rise in scrap prices once again, attributed to the increasing demand for steel due to large-scale infrastructural rebuilding projects in Turkey and Syria. These projects were initiated after a devastating earthquake hit both countries in February, causing the destruction of thousands of buildings.\n\nEntrepreneurs in the country's steel sector have reported that the situation has forced them to cut down on rod production by 40%-50%. This has made it extremely difficult for businesses in the sector to stay afloat.\n\nFactory owners are struggling to meet operational expenses, including employee salaries, due to the decline in production and sales. Those who have taken out bank loans to run their factories are facing the most serious financial crises, they said.\n\nKR Steel Ltd, located in Sitakunda, Chattogram, previously produced approximately 200 tonnes of mild steel (MS) rod (60 grade) per day. But its production has now declined to below 60 tonnes.\n\nTwo steel factories owned by the Mustafa Hakim Group in Chattogram - Golden Ispat and HM Steel - used to produce around 1,600 tonnes of MS rods per day. Production in the two factories have of late declined by around 40%.\n\nSarwar Alam, director of Mustafa Hakim Group, said that the steel industry requires a continuous supply of raw materials, electricity and gas. If there is a shortage of these materials, the production cost increases, and the machinery depreciation cost also rises.\n\n\"The destination of scrap ships in the international market is currently towards Turkey and Syria, as the Turkish government has gone for a quick reconstruction of the infrastructure damaged by the earthquake. As a result, the scrap market has grown in the international market,\" he added.\n\nEntrepreneurs are demanding the removal of obstacles in the import of raw materials to overcome the current crisis.\n\nTapan Sen Gupta, deputy managing director of BSRM, one of the top rod manufacturing companies in the country, said that while big companies are not facing significant problems, small entrepreneurs are struggling. To overcome this crisis, the ongoing obstacles in the import of raw materials should be removed.\n\nOver the past month, scrap ship prices in the international market have risen from $525 per tonne to $575 per tonne. Meanwhile, scrap prices have also increased from $430 per tonne to $460-$465 per tonne during the same period.\n\nThe price of scrap and MS rods in the domestic market has also become unstable due to the impact of the international market, with both increasing by approximately Tk5,000 per tonne in the last month.\n\nIn ship breaking yards, melting scrap is selling at Tk68,000 per tonne, up from Tk62,000-Tk63,000 a month earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the prices of steel raw material plates and billets have increased, with plates selling at Tk75,000 per tonne and billets at Tk82,000 per tonne, up from Tk70,000 and Tk78,000, respectively, one month ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of MS rods has exceeded all previous records, with MS rods of 75 grade selling at Tk97,000-Tk98,000 per tonne on Saturday, up from Tk94,000 a month ago.\n\nAbu Taher, president of the Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association (BSBA), told The Business Standard that only 20% of the demand for raw materials could be met through import due to domestic and international crises.\n\nFurthermore, the price of scrap in the international market has started to increase again. If this situation persists, the ship breaking sector will have to close down, he added.\n\nAccording to the Bangladesh Shipbreakers Association (BSBA), only 20-22 out of 160 shipyards in Sitakunda are currently operational.\n\nAccording to the Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills Owners Association, the annual demand for steel in the country is around 75 lakh tonnes. Previously, about 50 factories in Chattogram used to supply 40 lakh tonnes of rods. However, due to the closure of around 40 factories in recent years, the production of rods in Chattogram has dropped significantly to only 10-15 lakh tonnes.\n\nOn 6 February 2023, an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck some regions of Turkey and Syria, resulting in a death toll exceeding 52,000. According to the World Health Organization, more than 2.5 million people were affected by the earthquake.\n\nIn response, the Turkish government announced plans to construct over 300,000 houses in the affected areas and complete the process within a year."

    "fullArticle": "COVID-19 hit Turkey's economy mid-March. Most industrial sectors, including steel long product mills, halted production in April, when the nation's monthly crude steel output dropped 26.3% on year to 2.2 million mt, after a strong first quarter, according to the World Steel Association.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nDue to the adoption of stringent measures, the spread of the virus has slowed in recent weeks and most of Turkey's industrial sectors, including most steel mills, had restarted production as of the second week of May, in line with normalization efforts globally.\n\nHowever, the domestic steel market outlook is bleak for the rest of the year, despite government efforts to spur domestic demand by cutting interest rates. In Turkey's major European Union export market there are rising protectionist pressures.\n\nConstruction, typically the biggest steel-using sector, is expected to continue to shrink in Turkey during 2020 from 2019 levels.\n\nTurkish automotive producers - typically the second biggest steel consuming sector - plan to raise capacity use only gradually depending on market conditions, following a 91% on-year plunge in production in April, when white goods production shrank 54%.\n\nThe World Bank has slashed Turkey's growth estimate for 2020 to 0.5%, from 3% foreseen before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMills' capacity usage fell as low as 45% in April, according to Turkish Steel Producers' Association TCUD. Ugur Dalbeler, CEO of major producer Colakoglu, believes the second quarter will be \"hard\" for Turkish mills, with market recovery possible in the second half of the year. Turkish mills' 2020 crude steel output is expected to fall significantly from 2019.\n\nSharp exchange rate fluctuations, together with virus-related business interruptions, have significantly damaged most of the small, medium and even large Turkish steel producers' balance sheets, sources say. \"The first half of 2020 has been lost. Let's hope that there's some relief in the second half,\" a steel service center manager said.\n\nRelated infographic: COVID-19 latest blow to Turkish steel industry\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nTurkey produced around 33 million metric tons of steel in 2019 - 20 million mt of long steel products and 13 million mt flat steel - relatively flat on year, according to Turkish Steel Producers' Association TCUD. It was the eighth largest steel producer worldwide.\n\nSome 68% of Turkey's steelmaking capacity is electric arc furnace based, with 24 EAF plants, making it the world's biggest importer of steel scrap. In 2019 it imported 18.86 million mt of steel scrap, according to International Recycling Bureau BIR.\n\nAt the start of 2020, Turkish market participants were expecting a strong year following the halving of US Section 232 tariffs on steel imports from Turkey to 25% in Q2 2019, which helped Turkey maintain its steel exports last year.\n\nTRADE FLOWS\n\nTurkey's steel industry is dependent on scrap imports and on steel product exports. It typically exports 50% of its total steel output every year.\n\nHowever, Turkey's steel exports shrank by 25% year on year in April as a result of the pandemic, TCUD reported.\n\nThe sector is vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations and changes in global trade flows or protectionist currents that may lead to alterations in existing tariff and quota systems. In mid-May the European Commission started an investigation into allegations of dumping of Turkish hot-rolled coil into the EU. On May 25, Turkey notified the World Trade Organization that it could impose customs duties on steel imports from the EU in retaliation for the move.\n\nThe EC is also reviewing its steel import safeguards, which have temporarily reduced interest in Turkish-origin long steel imports. Following a sharp demand drop for Turkish-origin steel in the country's key export markets at the height of the pandemic, Turkish mills have recently booked large-volume rebar cargoes into Hong Kong and the US, suggesting some improvement in demand sentiment since mid-May.\n\nThe Turkish lira has fallen around 20% against the dollar since the beginning of the year as its depreciation has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe US is Turkey's largest ferrous scrap supplier, having provided 984,000 mt of scrap in Q1 2020 - around 250,000 mt higher on year - followed by the Netherlands and the UK. Russia in recent years has been Turkey's fourth-largest ferrous scrap supplier; however volumes fell off in Q1 due to lower prices and intensified competition from US and European suppliers. In Q1 the average price to Turkey was $270/mt CFR, down from $310/mt CFR in Q1 2019.\n\nRussia's scrap export trend to Turkey reversed in April when the pandemic paralyzed activity at US and EU scrap merchants, while Russian collection was not so greatly impacted thanks to milder restrictions on businesses. Last month the volume of ferrous scrap Russia's Rostov and Volga river ports exported to Turkey jumped by 65% to 35,370 mt, up from 22,000 mt in March.\n\nGoing forward, Russia's shipments will depend on the pace of steelmaking recovery in Turkey, as the scrap procurement price needs to be higher than the current $240/mt to make exports appealing.\n\nPRICES AND MARGINS\n\nTurkish mills' hot-rolled coil prices fell by as much $100/mt during March, hitting as low as $400/mt mid-April, as the pandemic reduced demand in both domestic and export markets.\n\nTurkish rebar export prices plunged $50/mt over three weeks in March before bottoming out in early April, and despite a moderate rebound remain significantly below the pre-COVID-19 level. An upturn in finished steel demand is expected with the end of Ramadan, although the impact of the coronavirus continues to depress demand. Turkish mills were heard to have sold large-volume rebar cargoes to Hong Kong, with prices heard at $390-$395/mt FOB Turkey for 55,000 mt shipments. A number of US-bound rebar sales have also been reported from three Marmara mills, but talk of rebar sales to the EU currently remains limited, with uncertainty surrounding the review of the EU steel import safeguards.\n\nTurkish mills were heard to have booked eight deepsea scrap cargoes late last week, ahead of the Bayram holiday, which took place May 24 until May 27. Six cargoes were sold by Baltic recyclers, with one heard from a UK recycler and another from a Benelux seller. Scrap sell-side sources expect Turkish mills to take a step back from scrap buying in the coming days, as their focus shifts to boosting finished steel sales.\n\nPremium heavy melting scrap HMS 1/2 (80:20) has traded within a range of $239-$252/mt CFR so far over May, with the downside limited by continued tight scrap supply, due to coronavirus-related collection restrictions and a sharp drop in the availability of new production scrap, following automotive stoppages in April in key scrap-exporting regions. The upside to scrap prices has been limited by poor domestic and export finished steel demand.\n\nImport prices for Turkish ferrous scrap had plunged to $207/mt, their lowest level in four years, in early April, on coronavirus-fueled concerns of demand weakness. Benchmark import scrap prices recorded a $60/mt drop from pre-coronavirus levels over the second half of March.\n\nThe Turkish long steel melting margin - the spread between Turkish export rebar and import scrap - has remained within a range of $147-$161/mt so far in May."

    "fullArticle": "In most world markets, except for the European one, prices for rebar are increasing at the beginning of March 2023\n\nRebar prices in most global markets continue to rise in March 2023. Quotations are supported by demand, which has been restrained during 2022 by negative expectations of a recession in the global economy.\n\nQuotation of rebar on the Turkish market, according to the price indicator Kallanish, for the week of February 27 \u2013 March 6, 2023, increased by $10/t, or by 1.3% compared to the previous week \u2013 up to $740-760/t. In general, since the beginning of the year, prices for rebar on the Turkish market have increased by 11.8%, or by $80/t.\n\nPrices for Turkish rebar began to rise after the country\u2019s government announced plans to restore earthquake-affected cities and neighborhoods within the next 3-4 months. After the relevant intentions were made public, the price of raw materials for steel production \u2013 scrap \u2013 began to rise. Some steel enterprises reported a complete stoppage of rebar sales in order to assess scrap costs and establish a break-even price for their products.\n\nDemand from Turkish rolled steel importers is currently low as current prices are uncompetitive. Some market participants believe that during the recovery of the cities affected by the earthquake, it is necessary to officially limit exports. The cost of rebar produced in Turkiye has become the highest in the world, which explains the lack of demand from foreign consumers.\n\nAs sales of Turkish rebar to export markets remain almost zero, suppliers from other countries do not miss the opportunity to enter new markets to compensate for Turkiye\u2019s absence. Egyptian producers are shipping Turkish rebar volumes to the Romanian market, while the US and Canada have become buyers of Algeria and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The presence of Middle Eastern and Russian plants is increasing day by day in Israel and Yemen.\n\nIt is expected that in the near future Turkiye will be left without export demand due to excessively high rebar prices. At the same time, it will not be possible to lower the quotation due to high domestic demand, which will be supported by the construction industry.\n\nOn the European market from the beginning of March 2023, the prices for rebar are adjusted downwards. In particular, rebar quotations in Northern Europe as of March 3, 2023, decreased by \u20ac70/t, or by 8.2% compared to the price on February 24 \u2013 to \u20ac750-780/t. In Italy, the price of rebar during this period fell by \u20ac10/t \u2013 to \u20ac690-700/t.\n\nRebar prices in Europe fell sharply due to lower consumption, especially in the construction sector. EU construction companies continue to shy away from rebar purchases despite inventory levels being low. This situation is observed in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain.\n\nA significant reduction in consumption is causing great concern in these countries. Steelmakers may resort to production cuts this month to avoid further price falls.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe\u2019s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal recently announced plans to raise long-term product prices by around \u20ac30/t to offset some revenue losses due to higher raw material costs, particularly, scrap. Therefore, the price of rebar on the European market will recover in the near future, but this will not be facilitated by the increase in demand, but by the efforts of producers to transfer the increase in production costs to the shoulders of consumers.\n\nChinese rebar market remains stable. As of March 3, rebar quotations were at the level of 4,130-4,150 yuan/t ($598-601/t). Market participants are waiting for the results of the meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress. Positive industrial production data from February, as well as the gradual recovery of China\u2019s real estate market, also support prices. But despite the labor shortage after the winter holidays and limited supply, market activity is low.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, rebar producers in the MENA region lose $50-70 million per month due to the change in global trade flows due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Initially, producers raised prices to compensate for losses from disruptions in supply chains. Later, prices began to fall due to the increased activity of exporters in search of new sales directions."

    "fullArticle": "Ferrous markets have seen major shifts in the past year with EU steel production declining, Turkish production and steel scrap imports also down, and a contrasting growth in Indian scrap buying, Fastmarkets price reporter Lee Allen told the BIR world recycling convention in Dubai.\n\nIn a presentation entitled \u2018Steel scrap markets in 2022: Turkish trouble and Asian ascendance\u2019, Allen said: \u2018What a difference a year makes. Healthy recovery in the EU and across the European continent has given way to cuts in capacity utilisation. It\u2019s been a year when Turkey has struggled to consume and imports volumes and those volumes have been replaced by South Asian buying. It\u2019s an enormous change of fortune.\u2019\n\nAgainst a backdrop of a 20.2% year-on-year fall in Turkey\u2019s steel production in July 2022 and a 40.9% year-on-year slump in steel scrap imports in July, Allen also noted that demand for finished steel has been poor. \u2018These trends do not come without consequences for scrap sellers across the world.\u2019\n\nUkraine war impact\n\nWhile higher energy costs and lower demand had played their part, the commodities specialist also indicated how Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had been \u2018a large contributing factor\u2019 in lower prices for scrap. Unable to sell in many markets because of sanctions, Russian billet traders had turned to Turkey offering cut-price deals.\n\nAllen pointed out that, while billet from Russia had rarely been over 50,000 tonnes per month before the conflict, by May that total was over 200,000 tonnes. He said it was no coincidence that Fastmarkets\u2019 cfr Turkey HMS (80:20) steel scrap price average had dropped from US$ 631 per tonne in April to a little over US$ 350 per tonne in September as the competition bit.\n\nIncrease in bulk imports\n\nTurning to the Indian market, he noted a growing preference for bulk scrap in the region. \u2018India has seen exponential increases in bulk steel scrap bought in recent months, with bulk prices becoming cheaper than containerised scrap.\u2019\n\nAllen reported how traders in India had taken positions of large cargoes of bulk scrap to sell to the local market where it is broken up and distributed while retaining margins. \u2018Last year we could not have predicted this,\u2019 he said. Fastmarkets forecasters, he added, were bullish on steel scrap and \u2018fairly bearish\u2019 on steel.\n\nThe shift in emphasis in Europe was underlined by the Division\u2019s President Dennis Reuter of TSR Recycling in Germany in a subsequent panel discussion. \u2018Inflows are not that high, to put it mildly, and we are really struggling to secure material. Due to energy prices, demand from the steel mills is not that great.\u2019\n\nCapacity boost in Bangladesh\n\nSanjoy Kumar Ghosh, head of supply chain management, BSRM Steels in Bangladesh, considered scrap demand, opportunities and future growth in that country. He pointed out that drivers included major new infrastructure projects and growing purchasing power with Bangladesh\u2019s GDP expected to rise 7.2% this year.\n\nHe, too, affirmed Allen\u2019s observations of a switch to bulk scrap imports, which had moving from roughly parity with container scrap in 2020 to a 68/32 split in the last financial year and 70/30 most recently."

The HMS portion of the cargo is broadly equivalent to $452 per tonne CFR for an 80:20 mix of the grade.\n\nA separate East Coast exporter sold a cargo to a different regional mill comprising HMS 1&2 (90:10) priced at $442 per tonne CFR, sources told Fastmarkets on Wednesday February 22. This would equate to $437 per tonne CFR on an 80:20 basis.\n\nAnother East Coast exporter was heard to have sold a cargo inclusive of HMS 1&2 (80:20) priced at $438 per tonne CFR and shredded scrap priced at $458 per tonne CFR to that same mill, Fastmarkets heard on the same date.\n\nA fourth North American exporter is also understood to be in the market to Turkey.\n\nPrior to these three fresh deals, prices were $420.50 per tonne CFR for HMS 1&2 (80:20) and $440.50 per tonne CFR for shredded and bonus scrap in a deal done on February 16.\n\nSources indicated that a further 500,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap \u2014 which could be as many as 16 cargoes based on a minimum tonnage of 30,000 tonnes \u2014 may be needed for shipment in March.\n\nGlobal ferrous scrap export market\n\nThe running tally for global cargoes booked by the region has now exceeded the 20 cargoes initially expected to be purchased in February.\n\nThese requirements are bolstered by reconstruction plans for the southeast of the country, which has been decimated by three earthquakes, the most recent of which occurred on Monday February 20.\n\nReconstruction \u2014 which the Turkish government has already said will require 4 million tonnes of rebar \u2014 is expected to begin in earnest in three to four months\u2019 time, sources stated, before indicating that a tender is now out to build 200,000-250,000 new houses as soon as March.\n\nA source estimated local Turkey rebar sales at $740-745 per tonne this week.\n\nUS sellers are already targeting prices higher than those in recent sales amid rampant demand \u2014 European sellers sold to Turkey at the equivalent of $433-439 per tonne for HMS 1&2 (80:20), and US exporters are keen to exceed that level.\n\nUS domestic sellers with export capability are also ready to reap the rewards of surging export in March\u2019s domestic ferrous scrap trade, with one seller in the Philadelphia market anticipating that increases will overtake those in February, when the local market rose by $20 per gross ton, particularly for prime grades.\n\nA European sale of busheling was recently concluded to Turkey at $467 per tonne CFR, which is equivalent to $472 per tonne CFR for US origin material. Philadelphia prices for busheling were $440 per gross ton in February, meaning that domestic mills would have to raise prices significantly just to compete with exports, not to mention be competitive in domestic negotiations.\n\nPrimes are going to have to be up $40 per gross ton at least\n\n\u201cPrimes are going to have to be up $40 per gross ton at least. Domestic mills are asking for a lot from us and if they want it, they\u2019re going to have to pay at least up $40 per ton to get it,\u201d a local seller there said.\n\nOther grades are expected to rise alongside busheling, but to what extent remains uncertain.\n\nSentiment for rising export prices to Turkey is also moving to the West Coast.\n\nAsian ferrous scrap buyers\n\nBuyers in India and Bangladesh have made bids to certain West Coast exporters of $460-465 per tonne CFR for shredded material but have been rebuffed, with sellers confident that the market is moving up on Turkey\u2019s coattails.\n\nWhen countered, a Bangladeshi buyer reportedly bid as much as $475 per tonne for the material but was again refused, with the price not deemed high enough by the exporter in question.\n\n\u201cIf prices to Turkey are going up, Asian buyers will try to deflect the increase, only to claim it affects them when prices are going down\u2026 But Turkey is a good barometer for us, and it is only a matter of time before we sell to Turkey if Asian mills won\u2019t raise prices,\u201d a West Coast exporter told Fastmarkets.\n\nThe freight differential for the two routes could be offset if prices to Turkey continue to rise \u2014 shipping for deep-sea from the US West Coast to Asia was broadly assessed at $47 per tonne versus around $65 per tonne to Turkey by sources on February 22.\n\nDock yard buying prices on both US coasts held firm in the week to Tuesday February 21, with rising export yet to manifest in buying prices."

In February, gas for industry became cheaper by 13-17%, and in March \u2013 by 21-26%\n\nThe Turkish Oil Pipeline Corporation (BOTA\u015e) is reducing wholesale natural gas prices for large industrial enterprises by 20.01% from April 1, 2023, compared to the previous month. This is stated in the BOTA\u015e press release\n\nIn addition, BOTA\u015e reduced wholesale natural gas prices for electricity producers by 16.67% m/m.\n\nCompared to October 2022, when gas prices in Turkiye reached peak values, the wholesale price of gas for industry as of April 2023 has decreased by 52.43-63.63%, and for electricity producers \u2013 by 51.52%.\n\n\u201cAfter this adjustment, the lowest price for natural gas among European countries is applied to our country,\u201d the message says.\n\nThis is the third decrease in the cost of gas in the country for industrial consumers in 2023. At the end of January 2023, BOTA\u015e announced that starting from February 1, 2023, it will reduce the wholesale prices of natural gas for large industrial enterprises by 13.3-17.2%. After that price adjustments took place in March \u2013 by 20.95-26.12%.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the regulator of the energy market of Turkiye announced about reduction of electricity prices for industrial consumers by 16%. The department also lowered the maximum price for electricity on the free market from 4.8 thousand liras/MWh to 4.2 thousand liras/MWh.\n\nRecently, the president of Turkiye Recep Erdogan stated that from April 1, 2023, the prices of electricity for all consumers will be reduced by another 15%.\n\nAs GMK Center reported earlier, in September 2022, Turkiye raised prices for electricity and gas for industry by 50%. The regulatory agency linked the rise in electricity prices to the rise in energy prices, especially under the influence of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe share of energy costs in Turkish steel sector has increased to 28-30% of the total costs in steel production against the background of the increase in the cost of gas and electricity. Turkiye\u2019s steel industry\u2019s capacity utilization rate has dropped from 75% to less than 60% as producers cut shifts or shut down operations.\n\nSteel production in Turkiye in 2022 decreased by 12.9% compared to 2021 \u2013 to 35.1 million tons. TCUD expected a fall in production by more than 13%. During the year, steelmakers exported 19.6 million tons of steel, which is 17.7% less year-on-year."

This situation could persist until June if the presidential election in Turkey goes to a second round.\n\nRussian suppliers were unable to sell at $380/t fob to Turkish buyers, with customers in Turkey assessing a workable PI price at $400/t cfr Turkey.\n\nIn Italy, scrap prices have dropped over \u20ac30/t ($32) on-month in May, with mills pushing for lower values because of slow finished steel orders. PI offers from the Black Sea ranged from $465-480/t cfr Italy, with the high side offered to foundries. Bids from Italian buyers did not exceed $450/t cfr. A mill source evaluates the Italian market at $440-450/t cfr. Italian pig iron distributors are offering at $510/t cfr to local mills.\n\nRussian-origin material offers were heard in India at $450/t cfr, but bids at $425-430/t cfr did not result in deals. A market participant predicts that prices in India will fall as mills there have experienced a drop in steel export orders and will be oversupplied.\n\nIn the US, the market anticipates bushelling contract settlement this coming week, with negative sentiment prevailing. Based on the most recent transactions, pig iron prices would still be assessed at the $550/t cfr Nola level, according to a market participant. However, one trading source reports that buyers in the US would expect $520-530/t cfr, considering the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike and falling scrap prices. Another trading source mentions that $510-520/t cfr Nola is \"in the air\u201d."
